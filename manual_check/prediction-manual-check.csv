"I have been thinking so much about Covid because it’s part of my job and well, who isn’t, right? The concern for me was about all the encouraged hand washing and OCD. Would that scratch that OCD itch in my brain? I got tired real quick about singing ‘happy birthday’ while washing my hands and it became clear to me that this is like life in that we can’t be perfect and striving to perfectly eliminate all risk is just not gonna happen, and increase anxiety. I have fear of contamination and that might get worse with Covid-19.

"There is a risk, however small, that tomorrow I will walk under a bus. There is a risk that I may get Ebola (can you guess what my OCD might be especially keen on at the moment?), that I might cause an accident, that I might hurt someone unintentionally, that I might leave my cooker on and burn down the entire student residenceâ¦ the list goes on. Every day we take a million tiny decisions and a million tiny risks.
Worse than all of that though is the risk that I choose not to take. There is also the risk that I donât face up to my OCD and that it ends up consuming my life, my dreams and my future.
You see, life is dangerous. There is scary stuff out there. And yet we have to make that choice â do we accept the uncertain, the unknowns and live with it (as those without OCD seem to do), or do we allow OCD to try to reduce those risks and spiral into isolation and fear, anxiety and terror. You see, in the face of uncertainty, I will (like most humans) leap to the worst possible conclusion. Instead of accepting uncertainty I will do everything I can to strive for the impossible, 100% certainty.
A huge part of facing my OCD has been about accepting uncertainty. I might get Ebola, but I might not, but those extra hours I spend washing my hands are definitely hours that I won’t get back. Because if I live continuously on edge, fearful that something terrible might happen, then Iâm not really living, am I?
Iâm not there yet â Iâm still not one for spontenaity, and Iâm not keen on uncertainty or giving up the endless doubt, but I do see that it's necessary. Iâm getting there. Slowly but surely, but I'm getting there.

"Hey guys
Hope everyone is still fighting the good fight!
I posted a few days ago with some suggestions my therapist had but it was during the bizarre forum deleting time period.
I was saying that I have bad anxiety in the mornings and my therapist made (in my opinion) a pretty valuable point regarding not eating in the morning increasing anxiety. She basically suggested that as humans we are still programmed to run on adrenaline as soon as we wake up in order to hunt and gather food. I never ate breakfast, just a coffee until midday. I'm forcing myself to eat breakfast and id like to report a definite decrease in morning anxiety! I know that caffeine can effect your mood so I'm trying (and failing) to cut down, although I've been looking Into it quite a bit and some studies seem to suggest that consuming high levels of sugar can be detrimental to your mental health. For me personally, when I have too much sugar I get shaky and my mind seems to jump about the place even more. So I'm thinking about trying to eliminate sugar from my diet for a while and seeing if it has any impact on my anxiety. I was wondering, has anyone else found reducing certain food groups/additives etc has improved your overall mood? Don't get me wrong I'm in no way saying cutting out sugar will definitely help, I don't know if it would and that's why I'm asking you guys what you think definitely becoming a believer in the idea that looking after yourself in every way you can can give you that little push in the OCD battle.

"Hello all
Ive just posted a topic on the BDD part as I feel As though I might have that, so I wont talk about my body issue and thoughts on this part.
I'm twenty two with Dyspraxia (dignose at 20) and I have a brother who suffers from Pure O (and is aspergers ) and my dad has OCD (also aspergers) so I have grown up around OCD, but because of my brother who is very serve with his mental illness I have been pushed to the back towards mine and have only recently started to address my problems.
I don't know if I have OCD and please dont be insulted if you think I dont and that i'm making a mole hill out of a ant hill, I have never dare to say or even post before as I have see my brothers torture he goes threw every day.
Lets get into then.When I wake up in the morning my thoughts are just so negative and if I'm honest there always negative. My mind constantly flashes back to a horrible moment in my life and when i snap myself out, my thoughts will run over and over and over this until i feel as it resolved or if it cant be resolved i will try and distract myself (one distraction I bite the sides of my fingers till the point it bleeds)it like im always in my mind and never in the real worlds because of this, the way I get out is that I seem to realise and snap myself out of it but if people are talking to me I can go complty in my head even if i dont want to and start to fantiszie (usually about me sorting problems out or a problem being resolved) the thoughts can be about people, Like if someone is hurtful towards be my mind will constantly go over this and i start to get really bad anixity and feel quite embarrassed like im real living it, I get to the point with people that they could do one mean thing but in my mind because i keep relving it and then I start to see other """"mean"""" things they do, that I just cut them out of my life and become really bitter towards them even if they done nothing else wrong. this has affected my jobs and education (ive quite many jobs and droped out of education often) and ive just started back at universtiy and i felt happy for 2 weeks but it all started up again to the point i hardly am in lesson and i just want to keep to myself
There is much more, But if im honest I feel to nervous to say the rest, as i have massive trust issue

"Hello Gang
I was asked earlier by a friend if I would lend her my laptop.
Albeit reluctantly (I do not dig others touching my belongings!) I agreed, on the proviso that my friend kept the environment in which it is to be used clean, and would wash her hands between handling food and touching the keyboard. This request has created something of an atmosphere.
I appreciate my need for cleaniliness is driven by OCD, but surely there’s a case for just ensuring that our stuff remains in as tiptop condition as possible. I really take care of my belongings, and would be horrified were it to be returned in a less than pristine condition.

"Hi guys,
Okay, this one's a little bit embarrassing. And before I go any further, I apologise if this causes offence to anyone.
As some of you know I'm a fan of Hollyoaks and during my last term at Uni, I became... eh... slightly obsessed with it, you could say and began to watch old clips on Youtube. :lol: I got some ideas for a """"McDean"""" fanfiction (ie, the relationship between Craig Dean and John-Paul McQueen) one night and I desperately wanted to write it down. However, some of you also know that I was reluctant to write it because of the whole thing with Father Kieron - viewers of the show will know that he gave up the priesthood to go into a relationship with JP and while all that was going on on telly last year I was reluctant to watch the show because I was still suffering badly from OCD; I thought it """"wasn't allowed"""" but hey, it's a teen soap on mainstream television that shows after school before the watershed! Something tells me it'll be okay! :lol:
Yet despite all this, as I became more confident and began to get watch more and more clips, I eventually decided to watch a few with Father Kieron and just became more confident. But all the same I guess you could say I felt guilty about it and I asked my Mum about it. She's a Catholic and she said that she believed that priests could go into relationships if it was what their hearts told them. I think I was going through a reassurance stage.
It's just... I would think 'oh, heck, let's just watch the clips of Father Kieron and lust shamefully after him' but then I would feel that I was beefing it all up. Was I doing it on purpose, just so I could have something to worry about? Did I go after it only because I thought it was wrong? I've just had all these thoughts in my head and I've been a bit worried that God's folding His arms and tapping His feet at me but I don't think that's true. I don't feel it right now, anyway.

Yes its important that we have the news for equality and democracy, but sometimes it spikes me more than a hedgehog. It doesn't help that it is often catastrophically pessimistic and pragmatic (me and functional dont go hand in hand).
I was watching it tonight, and it was about this horrible, over-weight grey 50 something Pyschopath, who assaulted and killed a 9 year old, and sent someone else in for his crime (Im sure you all know the story). All of a sudden I feel about as low as this disgusting human being, and feel like Im waiting to be judged accordingly (the same as he was). I think the animal in me (and all of us) will narrow my vision down to my fears and I wll go bad. These feelings always (always) make me wonder how people dont tie in OCD with self esteem, although it doesnt feel like we lack it..
Same old story, I panic and it feels real. If I ever became my anger, for example, could I hurt another? I know this is all stupid and repetitive but it makes me pretty darn terrified. After all, anxiety makes us tunnel visionned. Oh well, I guess Ill have to work on never being tunnel visionned.
That said; it is not a spike that seems to cause me too much pain. Instead, causing hurt to myself is kinda scarier, and this was on the news also (2 consecutive suicides). For someone with OCD who takes the World on their shoulders with control issues, the News can feel like Kryptonite. Does anyone relate? I mean, it is really necessary for us to know everything horrible that goes on in the World? How hateful, judgemental and messed up the general can be is also something that scares me, and sometimes I think the News feeds off it. Thats terribly pessimistic, I know.

"Hey everybody! :a1_cheesygrin:
I'm NightFire, I'm Female, 21, & I'm from Wiltshire [in England].
I found this forum as I was searching for people to talk to about my O.C.D-as nobody I know has it, or can understand it, & it's really difficult for me. :down:
I've had O.C.D for about 10 years [it's not been diagnosed, but I know that I have it]. I think that it was triggered when I was 11, & my family & I moved to a different area [& a house instead of a flat], & I had to go to a new Primary School . I think that it was a way for me to try & control my life more.
To give you an idea of some of the things I do/experience I'll write some below;
*Hoarding [mainly mags, & books].
*Checking [my room, my bag, myself, etc].
*Timetables [of what I should do every day, week, & month]
*Daily routine [certain things in a certain order].
*Routine cleaning.
*Negative, paranoid thoughts [about myself & others].
*Checking things online [like forum posts, my myspace page, etc].
*Trying to do everything 'perfectly'.
*Trying to give myself a 'life makeover' every now & again.
*Getting panic attacks, & depressed when things in my life 'don't feel right'.
I used to go to a Pychiatrist when I was alot younger [when I found out that my Dad was actually my Step-Dad], & I've been to a Counceller a few years ago after self harming a little [not much though]-but it didn't really help.
But I've never been to the Doctor about O.C.D [although I've thought about it], or been on any medication for it. I hate the thought of going on medication-as I'm Vegan, & I only take The Pill, & Paracetemol [which I only take at that time of the month!]. Other than that I take B-Vitamins, & Multi-Vitamins & Minerals. I hardly ever get ill, & [physically] I'm really healthy.
I also suffer from Depression [again, undiagnosed]-which I think is linked to my O.C.D.
Anyway...that's some background info about me I thought that I'd share-sorry for the essay!. :lol:
Actually, this is the most I've ever shared about this to anyone before... :blink:","['depression', 'checking', 'Medication', 'Thought']",0-1,0-1,1-1,checked
"Hey all,
I don't think that I've posted on here since my intro-but my life has been a bit manic lately.
Anyway; I just feel like everything is getting on top of me again...
I have so many thoughts going around in my mind, so many things that I want to do in my life that seem impossible, & so many things about myself, & my life that I constantly find fault in, that it's driving me mad. I just feel like life is totally overwhelming me at the moment.
The past 2 days have been really good; I went out with a School friend that I hadn't seen in ages on Sat eve, & it was ace-we had a great heart to heart about our lives. Then last night my 2 Best Friends came round, & we all had a laugh. But today I had one of those; 'I have to totally make-over my life because it's ****' feelings, & it's ruined it all.
I have a Dr's appointment today [which isn't related to OCD-as I don't *quite* feel ready for that yet], & a Psychology lesson later [which I'm freaking out about as I only have a week in which to do my Coursework, & I haven't even started it yet]-but I'm considering boycotting Psychology [again] as I feel like I can't handle it, as I'm losing my mind at the moment. :eek:
Here are some of the things that are getting me down;
Work: I work Part-Time, & I love my job & everyone that I work with-but I *really* need to get a Full-Time job asap as I'm not making nearly enough money to get by.
College: There's the Psychology Coursework issue, & the fact that I'm most likely going to fail GCSE Maths [again].
Career: I have dreams of studying Hollistic Therapies, & moving to Southern Ireland-but it seems impossible for me to ever do.
Family: All we seem to do is argue :argue:, & they can't seem to understand how I feel about anything [especially concerning my OCD]. I feel like I need to escape from living with them.
Friends: I always feel really insecure about my relationship with my friends, & what they really think of me, etc.
Love Life: It's non-existant! I have issues with trusting people, & I feel lke I'm going to be a Virgin, & alone forever at this rate.
General: The facts that I'm 22 this year, still living at home, not at Uni yet, not driving yet, don't have hardly any money, & generally aren't very independant at the moment are always on my mind.
I'm trying not to cry as I'm writing this-but I just feel like a complete loser...
I just don't know where to start on improving my situation & my life. I always put loads of pressure on myself, & give myself high standards to live up to-so therefore I tend to fail. So any advice that anyone can give me would be *greatly* appreciated.
Also; I am planning on going to the Dr's about my OCD/Depression very soon-I'm just plucking up the courage!
Peace & Love;

"Hi,
My name's Rebecca and I'm new here!
I haven't ever been medically diagnosed with OCD but I am definitely sure I have it, I can't talk to my parents about it and it doesn't bother me enough that I feel I need help desperately, it's just there for me.
Anyway, I decided to join this forum because although all my friends think they know loads about OCD (some still think it stands for overly cleanliness disorder- they will never learn) it's very frustrating to try to explain it to them as they enjoy making me skwerm akwardly when they move my things (I went on a trip to London with the drama department at school for three days and one boy spent every moment we were in the coach undoing my seat belt, something that is fair enough to be irritated by, and moving my arm rest slightly to the left).

Had a good time at the McFly concert (Dude! I did it; I went to a concert and like, didn't have a breakdown! :clapping: ) and now I'm back home again. But suddenly, I feel a bit down and out...
My friends are arranging to go out tonight and asked if I'd like to come; I wanted to, but I can't drive, none of my friends could come and pick me up, I don't know the town they're meeting in massively well and don't know the bus-times and my Mum and Dad couldn't give me a lift for various reasons.
And suddenly I got this big ol' wave of sadness and just had to go and sit on the swing for a bit. I suddenly felt mildly depressed and upset; didn't want to talk to anyone, didn't want to do anything, just wanted to be left alone.
And the OCD took the opportunity to kick in. I just got that whole """"My life sucks"""" kinda thing and had to take some deep breaths. I just felt all """"Blah"""" and although I know God knows how I feel inside and that most of my OCD is simply in my imagination; it ain't real. But sometimes I'm scared of just ruining my life for good although I know it'll never happen. Which is brill because I know I can live my life my way. It's just a 'what if...' I pick up the phone and I'm scared I might say the wrong thing, then.
But I won't. Not today, not tomorrow, not the day after that, or the day after that, or the day after that...

Well, my exams finish on Thursday, which I perceive as the 'big push.' :lol: Things have been a bit up and down and I've been a bit weepy, but I attribute this to stress and raised emotion. Is that okay?

"Hi gang,
Hope you're all okay this morning, I for one am feeling a little peculiar. Nothing new there than.
I think my OCD is using my thoughts against me. The other night I was getting ready for bed and I normally tend to think about sex a lot when I'm waiting to go to sleep. Anyway, this particular night I had a couple of naughty thoughts that are taboo in my religion and I was praying for help. My therapist had affirmed it was wrong, I knew it was wrong. I only remember one or two brief flashes of thought and of course you can't remember every little thing you thought. Heck, you can't remember everything you did the night before, can you?
Anyway, I was lying on one side and I remember looking at the white desk that's next to my bed and having a big jumbled thought about forgiveness - thinking deeply and I remember having an image of me walking around feeling sad - and then I rolled over and looked the other way. My OCD kicked in and I began to think that I was sinning by just having that one thought. It's not the first time I've had a feeling like that - I have a harmless thought and it's bombs away for the OCD! I do remember before I drifted off asking God to help me, to deliver me. Then in the morning it came back.
Now I think my OCD's got me thinking that I indulged in these thoughts with the intention to ask forgiveness in the morning and also that I'd have something to worry about. But the fact is, I think it's just pure OCD. I seem to be thinking now that I don't deserve anything but the truth is I just feel loved so much. I feel like the Big Guy is rooting for me.
But I don't understnad why I think I've done wrong. I was feeling better last night. I just can't comprehend why I think I've done something wrong. I wanted to know if OCD uses anyone else's thoughts against them like this. It feels like OCD now I've written it down. It was just this niggling, this feeling of being undeserving.","['hope', 'serving', 'OCD', 'Thought']",0-0,0-0,1-1,checked

"So I have 3 hours' sleep after some very bizarre nightmares and I am woken up by the kid downstairs singing """"Old MacDonald"""" at 6am...........
I get out of bed to find one of the cats managed to get locked behind a door so she pood so I had to clear that up.
I keep forgetting things to put in a bag to take to work and then I am 15 minutes late.
The car feels like it's driving on jelly or super glue depending on where Saturn is in the sky over Cassiopeia apparently........
Then I am in work and I am trying to focus on things but I keep yawning and I feel sick - nauseous - like every morning for the past 2 weeks (I swear I'm pregnant!!!).
So my colleague is talking to me about really important stuff and I am assaulted by unwelcome visions of accidents or fighting or situations where I am being hurt or attacked by people - which triggers my defensive side and the OCD throws visions of excessive violence into the mix against my detractors.............and at the same time I am supposed to be taking a brief for an important conversation.
I send a friend a couple of sms messages from my mobile - but I cannot do that too often as it's expensive...........and I cannot call her cos I am surrounded by people who understand enough English to know that it's not about work!!!
She asks me, """"What do you need right now to make you feel a bit better?"""" - well, what I need is impossible right now to get - that's the hardest part to accept - the fact that at this precise moment in time, I am all alone (there isn't even anyone else logged into the board right now) fighting this and it's ripping my mind apart - I just want to scream and cry and cry scream and cry some more then sleep for a week.............
The self-destructive aspect of my OCD/ADHD wants to rip my head open and spread my brains on the keyboard so I can smash the thoughts to a pulp. It makes me want to drive my car at 160km/h into the nearest river bridge and flush my low self-esteem into the Bottnian Gulf.
So I call my mother (some of you may recall her profession - she's forgotten more about OCD than I think I will ever learn!) - voicemail.

What's left?

"I figure whatever my OCD is trying to bother me with - it's not really connecting in my head. I cannot make sense of it all. I believed I'd done something wrong. It was like my OCD was supplying the guilt without any actual sin and I just don't think I've done anything wrong. I know I'm better than that. Anyway, everytime I have a thought that I'm supposed to have indulged in, I physically recoil.
I think I accepted that I'd done something wrong because my OCD made me believe that I had sin in a just-so thought. It's like I say something harmless and in my head it becomes harmful, you know and before long I think I've said wrong. It's not the first time something like this has happened and got me in such a state.
So I think the OCD has been hurting me because of this thought I had about forgiveness and worry and because of a few naughty thoughts. I can't even remember it now. But after having it, I felt weird. And before I slept, I prayed to God to save me. And the next morning, it began to grow and grow and grow.
And by this morning I was in a real state. But then I snapped out of it.
But now I'm just not bothered. I've been focusing more on my revision today.
But do you guys think that this was OCD? I feel like I've broken out, like there's nothing to worry about but I want to make sure this is OCD and not something I've done.
So I should just leave it behind, yeah?","['guilt', 'Thought', 'OCD']",0-0,0-0,1-1,checked

I'm sorry I haven't been around much, but, it's back. For some reason everything I watch is triggering me, it doesn't help that half the shows i've been watching seem to have paedophiles in them at the moment. I want to go back to avoiding it, but it's pretty much too late now anyway! I have exams coming up, I went on antidepressants in January, my dog nearly died, my step-dad's father died, everything has been pretty tough. I thought I was making progress, in fact I was doing really well, then I had exams in March, and everything with my dog and my family happened, and now I have more exams, and just, eurgh.
It definitely hasn't been a good few months, and I guess it's starting to take it's toll. I'm going to make an appointment with my doctor for the 11th, that's the next time I'm back in Birmingham, and I'm running out of tablets. Unsure whether or not to ask him to up the dose, I'm also getting therapy at the moment, but with revision and trying to juggle everything else I haven't been able to go for a while, and it's for the depression, not my OCD. My doctor has been amazing about my depression, really understanding and helpful, he got me therapy in a week on the NHS (!) and we discussed tablets a lot before I went on them, and I really felt that it was my decision and was very comfortable with it.
Although my doctor is great, i've always been hesitant about seeing anybody in the NHS about my paedophile thoughts (gahhh, that is NOT getting easier to say! lol). I've always seen a private counsellor back at home for CBT, but i'm rarely home now, so it's very inpractical for me to see her on a regular basis again. I want to be a clinical psychologist, i'm headed in the right direction at the moment, and I don't want this to go down on any records or anything. I've only ever wanted to work in the care proffession, I don't know what I'd do if that was taken away from me.
My boyfriend (who knows everything) has been on shift since Friday night pretty much, which hasn't helped, too much time to think and as he's doing shifts it's ended up mucking up my sleep as well. I guess I should talk to him about it, but it's difficult to say 'Hey honey, how was work? By the way, I couldn't revise today because I think I might be a paedophile again' :dry: Also, saying it out loud makes it real, and I don't want to have to fight this again.

"Why must my OCD get significantly worse when I'm around people? It's not near as hard to cope with when I'm alone. Around others I'm miserable, and I'm always around people I love! But OCD makes me think I'm committing some wrong toward them almost every time I say or do something. I constantly question my motives for doing or saying something before I even get to say/do it, I """"feel the fear and do it anyway"""", and just end up feeling horrible in the end. I thought overcoming OCD involved learning to deal with your fears, but it's horrible every time I try to do that. And I do expose myself to my fears a lot!

"Hey Guys,
I dunno what im really trying to achieve here, just venting really i suppose.
I went to the doctors last night, and am now regretting it. My mum doesnt want anythnig to do with OCD, and she doesnt want me to go to doctors, its got to such a point that i get really nervous when even thinking of the subject. So i told her i was at a meeting with the headteacher. On the way to doctors after school, i saw her picking my sister up, and said the meeting was cancelled and i was gonig to my friend (alex)'s house. So she drove off. Anyways i was walking with my other friend matthew past the doctors, and she was parked outside it, getting a prescription.
So i came up with another excuse that Alex's mum didn't want me there, so i was dropping something off at Matthews house. Anyways she sat in the car for about 5 or 10 minutes, and then left, in which i proceeded to the doctors.
Not only was there my mums friends in there, but relatives aswell. So i just walked past, signed in and went upstairs. When i was with the doctor, he said there was nothing he could do, and its too dificult to diagnose me, and i need to see a psychiatrist. He also wants a chat with my parents before we continue.
So how am i supposed to do that? He then made me re-live my violent and sexual thoughts, and speak about them. That made me really upset, it was awful.
Then he said next time he sees me he wants a list of all the Obsesions i have had, written down every time i get one. So ive started doing that.
---- * ----
Yesterday lunch i went outside, to find that people were spreading rumours about me, but i wont say what they are. But now lots of people think stuff about me and its awful. I was walking to school this morning and i could see people staring at me, saying """"Thats Him!"""" etc. (The rumours ARENT true!).
At break today, withing about 30 seconds of stepping onto the playground, and apple was thrown at my head. And everything is just getting worse for me.
Last night, i thought i had about 5 friends being:
- Alex
- Cat
- Rachel
- Matthew
- Nat
Anyways today, after getting more greif i was in a bit of a mood on the way home walknig with the top four. So when i was walking down Alex's street, he was saying he bet i couldnt carry a few sand bags. Now im not the strongest of people, but i managed 1 (Yes lets all laugh at Adam). Then this little girl - about 3 years younger then me, managed to pick one up, and throw it at my Waist, and it wasnt the most delightful experience i have ever had, it kind of stung ALOT.
So i was kind of stupid, and thought i dont need greif from ANYBODY else. So i thew her PE bag onto the road. In which Alex had a go at me, and told me to leave his property, Cat and Rachel called me Pathetic, and the little girl, Kicked Me as hard as she could. There that removes the top three friends, now i have two.
I accidently fell on matthew after tripping up and he had a huge go at me, and smacked me accross the shoulder, so i hit him back, and stormed off.
Now we are down to one friend. Nat. Who today had a huge go at me over nothing and told me to """"**** off"""". I have no clue what i have done, but she seems to dislike me, so i now have No Friends.
Yay me - im a loner.

The self harm has been getting bad again recently, and my upper arms are covered in cuts. I feel like i cant commit suicide, because somebody wants to make me suffer. I feel like i should be punished for everythnig i do and i cant take it any more.
Im starting to feel that somebody has made my friends go away from me, so that if i do commit suicide, they won't miss me.
Pressure at school is starting to become unbearable, i really cant stand any of this, and i have nobody to talk to. Because my non-existant friends dont want to listen, my parents arent going to listen etc.

I was feeling a little weird today and when my Mum came home and did something that annoyed me, I went to my room and had a cry. I felt so and I actually threw a cushion across the room. I dunno - I just wonder if I wanted to feel sad and now my mind is obsessing over it.
The thing is I see rumination itself about certain stuff as a sin - but I'm only human after all. My OCD puts doubts into the mind now about why I was crying - did I do it deliberately or what, am I bringing myself down for no reason? It's not good for me but I dunno - it was strange. Maybe I just needed a cry or maybe it was a mood-swing and my mind was vulnerable to the doubts.

"Today I saw a girl who looked between the ages of maybe 11-16, its hard to tell as she was very well endowed.

I have a fetish for large breasts and so I found myself quite turned on and I couldn't stop thinking about her breasts and imagined myself having sex with her. What disturbs me is whilst I was imagining having sex with her, I imagined myself saying to her 'did mummy buy that bra for you?' and it really turned me on. Obviously this worries me as, why would I have had this thought if I hadn't had the idea of her being a child in the back of my mind.
I kept feeling aroused, and later on I gave in to my arousal and masturbated over her. What is worse, is whilst I was masturbating, I believed her to be around 11 or 12 and in my fantasy, I say to her, 'you're a little overdeveloped for your age aren't you?' and she replies 'I know I am do you want to **** me?'. This for some reason really turned me on. I was mainly attracted to her breasts and not her age, but I don't know why I would incorporate her age into the fantasy? I don't seek out young girls. I have only ever masturbated over girls from at least 14 and up. I'm 19 myself. Maybe its the taboo of having sex with a young girl who is overly developed and so is physically appealing, but is morally off-limits.

He has said that being on effexor and mirtizipine might not be right for me (as i looked them up myself and kinda forced the doc to give me them 5 years ago) and i will be reducing these and switching to pregbalin and anafranil over the coming weeks and months and trialing things until i start to feel better, still feeling cynical and sick in my tummy but im a bit more hopeful that things might be finally changing for the better,, he also took blood samples to investigate if there are any other physcial problems like too much haemogoblin etc,, its such a relief to meet people who are genuinely concerned and not the usual """"shut up and get on with it"""" mentality of ignorance.","['site', 'Thought', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'guilt', 'sweating', 'itching', 'hope']",0-0,0-0,1-1,checked

"Alot of OCD is put in a category such as the excessive hand washing thing or the hoarding thing or the self-harm thing but .... I have such an extensive mixed bag of OCD it is very hard to pin it down to one thing. When I went to the OCD conference in London a few years ago, I had severe difficulty deciding which 'class' to go to as i have a bit of everything. I will give you a brief account of a typical day - now this may go on so i'll keep it brief.
I will get up - get to the bathroom : first thing. I have a thing with taps. If I turn a tap on it will takes me aaaaaaaaaaaaaaages to turn it off. I will turn it on, off, on off for ages so I have taken to fill a bucket of water (2-3 times a weeK) and jug it out into the basin and use that (cold).
Getting dressed can take up to 20 minutes to half hour. We're not talking figuring out what to wear - we are talking putting on a pair of trousers and a top. Im that bad at putting my bra on with the clasp business (on, off, on, off), I end up sleeping in it and end up having one on 24/7 (obviously when I change it, it is when I get in from work so its not last thing at night or first thing so I can take time).
Then when I am about to leave the house I hve a ritual thing and I have to look at my light in the mirror and then my lamp on the floor and say bye to them???? about so many times (madness). Then I say bye to my pets in a sort of way and say a little prayer thing (like Ashley, I am not religious at all but I have to do it).
Then outside my door, again, I say bye to my pets for another say, 5 minutes. I have to make sure they look at me before I go to shut the door. I will swing the door back and forth countless times until im satisfied before locking it.
Just to do a simple wash, dress, say bye to the animals and lock the door takes me nearly 2 hours every morning.
When I use a squeezy bottle for anything: washing up liquid, shampoo, bubblebath, I squeeze nearly all the stuff out before I use it. Costs me a fortune.
Wow.. right. cards .......... table... completely out for everyone to see! Please please someone please tell me you endure the same things. Is this pure O or is this a bit of everything?

"Hi all
For some while now I have been feeling really down about lack of friends / living alone and lack of big family Christmas. December the 6th I was diagnosed with diabetes which was a bit of a blow. The not so obvious problem was that with diabetes, the medication I am on (olanzapine) is having to be changed over to aripiprozole as olanzapine can cause diabetes as well as worsen it.
4 days into the transition I am starting to get ruminating thoughts, which delve into the depths of my brain trying to find reason in everything that goes wrong in my life. Thoughts that are trying to explain why I have only 1 friend who lives 200 miles away, why I have lived alone for nearly 4 years and have not ever had a girlfriend that has lasted more than 10 minutes, thoughts like I am not meant for all of these things as I am meant for something else, as if I am destined to be alone for a supernatural reason. I am trying to let the thoughts just pass through my mind without fighting them, but it seems there is no end to the thought trails as the thought trails keep evolving.

"Hi everyone
Having a REALLY bad day. It's probably a mixture of my ocd and anxiety....
I have panics about getting ill, catching things, etc....mainly because when I feel unwell I go into a sheer panic - feeling like i'm going to die....it seems unlike other people i really cannot stand the feeling of being unwell, that is anything that involves nausea, faintness.....and unfortunately I witnessed someone die suddenly and I keep having that image going around and thinking that could happen too if i'm ill.
I'm particularly like this when I travel....
Today I returned from an event that is only 100 miles away because I was finding the whole thing 'too much.' Just everything from the numbers of people there, the queue for food....I kept having thoughts 'i don't have the energy for this,' and also i didn't sleep a wink so I was convinced that I would be feeling faint or sick by the end of the day ......so i left before that even had a chance to happen. :-(
I should go back tomorrow....I want to - it's just that as soon as I get there (it's a busy event) I feel like i'm in another world.....
My panic got so bad today that the wrist tag that they give you - i ripped it off because i felt claustrophobic with it around my wrist!
I thought once I got home I would feel differently, calm down a bit - I have a bit but not enough - nowhere near what I usually am.....and I have to go back tomorrow, I want to i've spent a lot of money on this event and I know it's good for me to push a bit harder.....tonight is my respite but to stay home is avoidance.
Can anyone help? Right now I could cry all night. It'sw not specific to ocd - although there's a bit of 'if i could only guaratee 100% that i don't get ill, then I could enjoy the event...' So i'm trying to get the certainty that Dr Grayson talks about...
thanks for listening :-( :-( :-( :-( (by the way i live alone - and I can't even call anyone because people are so judgemental about it - they just get more and more into the label and they are not helpful - so I don't want anyone to know....but it means i feel so alone)","['anxiety', 'anxiety', 'nausea', 'Food', 'joy', 'syncope', 'OCD', 'Thought']",0-0,0-0,1-1,checked

Earlier with friend who got in my car I said how r u? and she said 'I've been pi££ed off today' and i started to say something because i think i thought she was referring to when we were bickering earlier on but quickly realised she meant with work. I'm worried tho that for a second i thought she meant something sinister or i ahd it in my head that it was something sinister and spoke based on that, simply because all i think about is sinister stuff.
She also said 'I can't believe its end of march already, time flies' and i said 'i know its creepy' and have panicked like 'why did i use the word creepy?'
My main concern is I was telling friends a story i read about a man trying to kill this woman in her own room and I said something like 'u wouldn't be able to scream tho, its like when u...' and i changed it to 'like i read that if you are that scared, u can't even scream'. now I'm petrified thinking what did i actually say, what did it imply and what the hell did i mean? for some reason i think i had like a faint memory of being young and trying to cry out and couldn't but I'm petrified that I've made it up and am remembering it as my dad being untoward with me when i best not be cos that will not be true at all and i will be distraught if iv mentioned it based on thinking that!! I kind of feel i remember dreaming something like that where i was trying to call out for whatever reason and couldn't, and kind of feel i remember being younger and just scared at night, NOTHING TO DO WITH DAD! just like house noises or id watched something horrible on tv or just scared like kids get in the dark at night occasionally. But what if I'm remember thinking at the time 'is that dad?' hearing a noise and not being able to scream? Maybe thinking it was him in a bad way or hoping it was him i could hear and not some stranger in our house. Ah I'm so scared of myself and my mind. My dad is such a lovely man.
Even driving this evening with my friends, twice i was like 'ah' as I went to interrupt my friend speaking to say something else, like once was cos i thought i missed turning to other friends house and can't remember other but i think did i do it intentionally because she said something sinister or about dads being pervy or something'
Also at bar i was saying a man was fit. Im 24 and i said lets hope he's 40. I like older men when not that old i guess and i don't know why i said it. I knew my friend would be like 'ew thats like your dads age' and she did, and i laughed and said 'oh yeah, oh yeah maybe not'. But I'm so worried whether i raised eyebrows or pulled a face as if to say 'i know, and?'. Is that like I'm saying i like my dad in a fanciable way or so what if he's like a dad age? Was i saying it like kind of a joke? DiD I just not care or think about what it would imply, did i think she wouldn't be sure what i meant so doesn't matter. Did i said 'i know, and?' or 'and?' or 'so' or 'i know' cos i know ports sounds like I'm saying i like that fact but 'i know, and?' would more mean 'so what, its only an age'. But i think id say it to test myself, to see what it implied and what she thought? please help me.

"Hello everyone
i had my second therapy session the other day, after hvg missed last week's one due to feeling awful and we talked about the self perpetuating cycle of anxiety, punishment, perfectionism that i am on. He did a diagram of the cycle, which just helped to reinforce the idea clearly at a time when i feel i have failed big time and cant see my way out of my troubled mind at all..
Yesterday, despite not feeling right or happy about doing it, i went ahead and bought something that i had been trying to for nearly a week. It was something that had broken which i wanted to replace. Beforehand i had got into thinking that i couldnt get it and the feeling was very strong and this for me is hard to get out of and takes time, effort and misery. Anyway, as i said, i didnt wait 'till i felt i was allowed, but bought it anyway (it is on order) and the same day went and had my hair done which i have been thinking about for ages. I hoped that i could start feeling ok soon but the anxiety and lack of peace of mind from doing these things and what has led up to them is driving me crazy. i cannot think straight and wonder if i will have to return the item if i cant settle down which is the worry (i cannot of course return my hair which is partly why i went to the hairdressers yesterday - to make myself live with it - maybe a wrong approach? i dont know.)
I've had a gutful of lately and feel that i made bad, unnecessary, habitful choices that caused the misery. So i went for the 2 exposures above to try to show that i can be strong and 'do the correct thing', but i am really scared that i don't deserve to feel okay about having the things and that i haven't done the exposure right - too much at wrong time or whatever. I also think that i did it because i couldn't stand to be without things any more, not because it was right to do it.
I regret that recently i have not been able to take the baton and run with it when i felt good about things and had a bit of progress under my belt. i blame myself terribly for messing up that chance and now i am having to stomach this self enforced exposure which i had to do in desperation. i dont know if it is possible to live peacefully with what ive done and accept its right.

im not sure i even know what i want anyone to tell me. i have terrible harming thoughts and wishing harm to come to people i care about. i cant stand it anymore. this is so hard for me to write cos im almost sure if you're reading this you will understand, but theres always part of me that thinks people will think im a sicko. i hate these thoughts so much. the thing thats terrifying me is that alot of the time its about my mum. its as if the ocd has found the ultimate torment for me, to constantly plague me with terrible thoughts about the person i prob care most about. im scared that seeing or speaking to my mum is going to trigger the obbsessions, i cant live like that. i hate myself for all this. why do the thoughts have to be so bad, why do they have to be there in the first place? maybe thats the point to the illness, there is no 'why'. i dont know.ive been in hospital, its coming up to a year now since i was addmitted. im just starting to come off medication(citalopram) its never worked anyway. and cbt didnt do much either. dont get me wrong tho, ive had some very good times, and found that self help can be a very very strong weapon. a book i read which changed things a lot for me is 'tormenting thoughts and secret rituals' by ian osborne. he's a psychaitrist who has/had ocd. its very compassionatley written.
im rambling here now. its just the idea of the person actually being the trigger that is scaring me. i love my mum and family so much, but this feels neverending.

"hey, i dont know if this is the right place to say this, but it describes depression on the forum description thing.
Apart from the ocd thoughts, there are 2 things that are bothering me. the first is that im really really paranoid all the time, and i dont know how to stop it. like, in class if i hear someone laugh i get convinced its at me somehow, and i know its irational. also, im really convinced that everytime i try to say something, or answer a question, everyone laughs, because they do laugh, but i think im being silly to think its at me. but i cant help it. im getting more confident at college, but if i walk past someone and they move their hand, i flinch. its very annoying, but i cant stop that reaction. its getting to the point that im having to tense my body as i walk past people just to control that, but that makes me look strange, so people are more likley to give me trouble.
the second thing is that i keep hearing voices. in the past ive heard voices, and i see things. ive heard 3 voices recently, and usually i would dismiss it as just mis hearing things, but ive identified it as the start of what happens. i hear a voice every so often, until before i know it there are what sounds like 2 people standing outside my bedroom door having a conversation, or talking to me. it doesnt bother me as such, as im not scared, but i know there must be something wrong if im hearing voices.","['depression', 'OCD', 'Thought', 'outside', 'bedroom', 'talking']",0-0,0-0,1-0,checked

"Hi.
I haven't been on here in a while so said I would come back and do an update. It positive to see lots of new people on the boards and I hope that the regular posters from 6 months ago are out there dealing with their OCD issues. Remember these boards are great to learn but are also a form of reassurance which will hold you back from fully functioning.
I am delighted to say I am well on the way to recovery. I can get through my daily routine with relative OCD ease. I do get more anxious towards the end of a work day but I notice I get more and more time each week. Larger events are more difficult but even these do not provoke the same anxiety as before (although I am quite worried about going away for a wedding for a full week this month). In saying that at least I am in a place now where I can handle it.
Recovery for me has been slow. It was July 12 months ago when I began to recognise my problem as OCD and it took a full year before I would say my problem was largely manageable. After the year mark things have started to become easier and gains are somewhat exponential. I would describe tackling OCD as trying to dismantle an massive block of ice with an ice pick. Initially you chop away, little by little with no observable effect. Then over time the ice begins to thaw and the chunks falling off are bigger and bigger until you are pulling away strips.
The most important tool for me tackling this has been ERP. I have put myself into OCD provoking situations as often as possible to create anxiety and constantly test myself. I look at my month ahead and see what I can do new in the month ahead that will provoke my OCD and help me to build coping techniques. In July it was to join a public speaking club. This month it was to start working out with a new work out buddy.
I have done OCD to the point of exhaustion. I have been physically ill alot over the last year as the stress from dealing with OCD has made me susceptible to common colds and flu. I notice how my days and weeks tire me out and then try to add on ERP exercises when I am at my lowest ebb. I then compare my frame of mind to a month ago or several months ago and improvements become more marked with time.
Another key to unlocking OCD is no longer fearing your theme. If you do this you remove all of OCDs power. This may involve temporarily accepting absolutely terrifying things. Once you no longer fear the reaper you can reassess when you have some perspective on what is true or not.
Stopping my reassurance activities has been another important step. Attention to detail is very important here. I have had some help from a therapist and he helped me to identify all my reassurance techniques and to spot myself doing them in real time and then stopping them. The real key here is to identify when you are doing them. Not easy but again over time it becomes easier.
I hope people on here are ok. These boards have been very useful to me getting through this. I wanted to share some of my experiences and hope others can take encouragement from them.","['fall', 'exhaustion', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'fear', 'hope', 'OCD']",0-1,0-1,1-1,checked

"Hello,
Recently my faith in God has increased considerably these last few weeks and I do notice a difference in my OCD because of this. Having faith is helping me to deal with OCD in a different way. My OCD does try to doubt my faith but I won't let it deceive me. I was wondering that if mentally blocking out OCD thoughts again and again could do some long term damage to someone later in life. I don't know if it's possible and I hope it's not. Occasionally I get a splitting headache and I wonder if it is due to mentally blocking out OCD thoughts. With my faith increased now I usually let the thoughts through, because they are not mine and God knows this. I know that non- OCD people get thoughts that they don't like but they dismiss them. With me a thought may try to hound me until I am physically crying or end up arguing with it, in which case it wins. Getting angry with a certain distressing thought makes OCD stronger. It doesn't matter if you are the nicest person in the world, you will still get distessing thoughts at some point. I think this is due to your brain/mind trying to make sense of the world we live in. I've mentined this technique before but I'll say it again in case anbody reading this doesn't know of it: if a distsressing thought comes, think to yourself OCD, so that your brain/mind can register it as an OCD thought, and the thought should go away.
This really does work so don't give up trying this. My faith will get me through this, I know it will.","['hope', 'OCD', 'Thought']",0-1,0-0,1-1,
"I want to let you know that despite my good knowledge and experience around OCD, I have many issues and it seems that I messed my self again.
I am in a very bad mental state right now. My OCD won't let me Study, make relationships, and be able to work.
I am in my early 30s, male, and not proud of my condition at this age. I am Currently unemployed, trying to study for some exams for the Public Sector, and having my OCD problem throttling again to decorate my already bad mental State.
My mom, blames me for my state, and she pisss me off. She is a B. when she reminds me of my age and that I should grow up and stop acting like a child and that my problem is ME and nobody else. I hate fighting with her about whether is her or me who is responsible about my condition. I know that this mentality doesn't help but I still say that she is to blame for last time. because she has always been a B. and abusive with my troublesome personality, even if all the world is blaming me. I am without friends, without girlfriend, and I know the only reason is because I can not respond properly in my interactions.
I suffer from serious OCD issues since childhood. Many times Doctors attempted to fix me with medication and Psychologists with psychotherapy but they partly failed......in the long run...Going to a doctor again is not an option for me anymore. I know what medication to take in order to feel """"temporarily"""" good, I HATE ALL THOSE SIDE EFFECTS,.....NOT AGAIN.......I am tired of next door """"Specialists"""" and they don't seem to exist in my area.
My OCD Manifests in many different areas. Really many. The latest serious attacks followed my attempt to study for some Job exams. Its a, lets call it """"Quality"""" Audio System Set I have in my car and I feel guilty to have it there. What if I get into an accident, what if I hurt someone , what if I have to sell the car? Every time I assemple parts of it, disassemple them and then assemple them all over again and again.
Lately I decided to study for some exams for a new job. My mind now asks me for a new ritual. To disassemble the system completely from my car, sell it and leave the Factory Radio back on, so finally OCD will completely let me alone. On the other hand I doubt if my OCD leaves me alone after performing the ritual, and at the same time this is impossible, because of the exams I decided to do for my own career future. I am afraid to perform that ritual and disassemble the Audio system from my car. I don't know if it is a ritual or the last task I will have to perform before my OCD leaves me alone. If really a ritual it is a big ritual. I will have to open the car completely and it takes time and energy at meantime I feel no reason to do that. I don't feel I can do it right now. I have other more significant priorities to do....
What I need here is a human touch to my problem and not doctors.....I need humans who suffered from similar conditions and they are experienced face to face with the condition.
People do not tolerate my strange, stuck, personality and leave me before they know me. I wish I had some good friends, but I am totally left alone in this world.

"My friend partly influenced me to do this as an idea, and I think it could be beneficial to most people on this forum. Basically, when you suffer from OCD, it's very easy to get sucked up into negative feelings. Bad thoughts, bad moods, bad everything. And I've started doing this in order to remind myself that, actually, even in the thick of all this nastiness, there are still things that can be valued and make us happy.
So basically, the idea is this: Keep a diary for 100 days straight in which you make at least one entry every day about what made you happy. These things can be as big or small as you deem appropriate. It doesn't have to be as personal as I've done it (I'm keeping a diary), for example, my friend is putting up a picture on facebook every day of one thing that made her happy. It doesn't have to be huge, you don't have to force it, and you don't have to always feel like it's 'worthy' of an entry. It just has to be SOMETHING. For example, my first entry was coffee. The day of that entry was horrible, awful stress from college, awful time with the OCD, awful time with the people in my waking life... Rubbish day. BUT. The one thing I always look forward to is a black coffee when I get in from college. So, I put it in the diary.
This idea doesn't have to be limited to 100 days. You could do 365. You could only do 50 if you wanted. Hell, you could only do a week if you wanted to. But I'm only two days in and I can already feel a bit of a difference. And when it's over, I'm going to look back over the whole thing, a and I'll see nothing but things that made me happy. There will be no mention of OCD, no mention of exams, no mention of anything negative. Just one thing every day that made me feel a little bit happy.
Anyway, it's just a suggestion, but I think it's a good thing, just because it's not exactly difficult to commit to and you can't really cheat at it because it's a self-fulfilling thing anyway.
Hope this helps somebody and good luck

"12 years ago, I freed myself through the Grace of God from O.C.D. after being severely afflicted by it for most of my life and an especially intense 5 years. All I did to overcome it was simply the opposite of everything I felt compelled to do. If I wanted things straight, I'd make them crooked. Perfect, then imperfect. Clean, then messy. It was one of the most liberating experiences of my life! I sort of transformed into a circus clown for a bit of time due to how much glee and freedom I felt. Don't let anyone tell you that it is only something that can be coped with but not fully healed. I am 1,000% healed, and you can be to! When you feel a bit of tension due to some obsessive habit not being obeyed, just know that that tension will steadily decrease as you continue to joyfully disobey what you feel needs to be ordered, straightened, etc.. I wish you complete success! I have another friend who also became fully healed due to someone simply telling him in regards to his unseemly habits, """"Just stop doing it."""" It IS as simple as that and, once again, remember that any initial tension due to not performing a certain habit will eventually be replaced by exuberant freedom! Doing the opposite is most certainly the quickest way to taste that freedom as opposed to simply not doing the habit. Enjoy making it through this unusual spiritual initiation!

"Hi everyone. It is my day 5 taking citalopram 10g.
I have heen suffering from OCD that makes me fear of disease and death. Particularly I'm afraid of rabies, as a month ago my right hand was cut by wire after a vaccinated dog had licked the hand. Also it bit me lightly and no obvious wounds were left. I know the fear is irrational and I keep searching information from internet.
Medication's side effects make me even more anxious. These days I suffer from increased anxiety and depression. I feel headache and pain in my hands and legs including the part cut by wire as mentioned above. This recalls my fear of rabies. I keep touching my forehead to know whether I have fever.

Anyway, fast forward to now and OCD was manageable through pregnancy. It reared its head with the same old thoughts from time to time but I did ok. It has now been 11 days since the birth and I am struggling a bit.
My theme has always been 'what if I cheated and forgot' or 'what if I got pregnant from the toilet seat'. Same theme this time and not helped by the fact that it seems to have focused on the fact my partner has 2 older sons living at home and every time I see them it triggers the thoughts. I am trying really hard not to reassurance seek. I am struggling with rumination - re-tracing my steps, trying to prove if I did wrong or not and confessing the thoughts to my partner and my mum who have been great and know not to re-assure.
However, just the fact of discussing the thoughts themselves is making me feel dirty and guilty. Scared at what this type of thought means about me. I actually feel physically dirty and like I don't deserve to be happy. I am scared of spoiling it for my partner too. I feel like I need to prove 100% for this to stop :'(
It was quite a traumatic birth. I lost a lot of blood, found out I had strep b and baby had it from the swabs (they don't test routinely in the UK) and I spent days scared of losing her. After 3 sons i was ecstatic to be having a daughter.
Just a bit of history - I left an abusive marriage 2 years ago. My ex-husband was emotionally abusive (not all the time as he was lovely too). He threw my OCD at me in front of the kids which resulted in me almost having to justify myself and hope they didn't believe the thoughts. My ex managed to turn our 18 year old son against me and I miss him massively. He has said such awful things to me.
Anyway I have rambled on enough. Some advise would be greatly appreciated as I am back to thinking maybe I don't have OCD at all especially as the thoughts are back and I am with a different partner who is wonderful.

"Hello
First time here. My son is nearly 12 and is beside himself with anxiety. I have taken him to doctor doc said he has a social phobia (my son dosn't like eating in public). My son is also scared of being sick (he hasn't been sick for 5 years). At night he is scared of going to sleep incase he dosn't wake up and is frightened of something bad happening to us. I am taking him back to the doctors next week but felt the need to join here and possibly get some advice. last night we were both cooking dinner together and I ended up shouting at him (something I have never done) he reacted very badly and was beside himself. He explained that he felt everything was his fault and that he felt ashamed of himself. I re-assured him that he shouldn't feel that, and that sometimes people will get angry with him, and that he should just forget about it. Anyway it came time to eat, again he started crying saying that he had that feeling again (feeling that if he eats he will be sick). He did eat his dinner but not a lot. Im sorry to ramble but it has really helped me to write this. Looking back I can see he has a really big problem and that action is required as soon as possible. He is a high achiever at school and has friends so socially he is ok. Seems to revolve around eating and sleeping. Any advice would be appreciated.

"Hey everyone, my name is Callie Alice and I am 18 years old from Essex in the UK. I have been a severe sufferer of OCD for the past 11 almost 12 years. It began when I was 7, and I sadly lost my parents in a tragic accident, and not long after their death I developed Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. I have always thought myself kind of crazy, because my ritual is actually pretty dangerous and I have been in hospital due to effects of it on more than one occasion. My OCD revolves pretty much around numbers and magical thinking. I have huge supersticious thoughts but the main issue surrounds the number after 12. (Triskaidekaphobia) and the devils number. I can't say it or see it and when I do my ritual is counting loudly and repeating each number 7 times, and then I hurt myself. It is pretty scary, and I actually currently have my arm in a bandage after an event including scissors a few nights ago. (I'm okay ). In late August, I actually was hospitalised after I stabbed my own side with a knife, which was extremely dangerous. I have been having CBT sessions and E&R sessions once a week since and I can see an improvement, and I have also been given different medication which is effective. I have managed to get off the knife thing however I kind of still have to hurt myself. That's what my ritual is. I do hate it, who wouldn't? But I am getting help and I am going to get better ~Callie xx","['Medication', 'Thought', 'anger', 'OCD']",1-1,0-1,1-1,Checked

Anyhow they rand home today and my brovanswered and now i think he's worried and now I'm worrying that hes worrying etc..
On top of that I am thinking what if the Dr thinks psycharitrist first, is this a bad sign, why can't i do psychologist first and worrying about that. :helpsmilie: Recently I have wondered if i am just really anxious, or i have got OCD type '0'.

"Hello I'm Michael, I am 13 years young and from England. I have made an introduction about my story so far which you can read here:
It all started in 2008 when I was in Year 5 of my school. I was young, energetic and loved the outdoors. Until I started to act funny, my parents noticed my strange behavior but thought nothing of it until my hands started to get raw like I'd been burnt. They asked me why my hands looked like this, I told them I was washing my hands. They took my to a doctor and they suggested I go to this house which deals with these kinds of problems.

After a long wait they concluded I had Anxiety and O.C.D, I obviously being my age didn't understand. I started to stop going out as much, I had friends I just didn't have that motivation I had a few months earlier. I hadn't been given any support when I was going through a tough time. I lost all my confidence, socialization and ability, this was going to affect me later in my life.

Two years later I moved into my new school, this is where the biggest problems started. After moving I was really afraid of my new school as there would be more pupils and people I've never seen. I was fine after I settled in, made a new gang of friends, everything was going good but then I was struck by a new problem that was caused by my O.C.D. I started to think my school was seriously dirty and had germs everywhere I went. When I came home from school one day, instead of just sitting down I went up-stairs and took a shower and chucked my school clothes into the washing basket. I started to stop touching stuff I had touched with my school uniform before this had happened (Door handles etc.) , I started to not finish homework or write up sanctions I had been given. Again my parents noticed this strange behavior and I went back to the """"Mental house"""" to have another diagnoses and they decided I needed to start something called cognitive therapy, basically what I had to do was touch everything I wouldn't choose to (Xbox etc.) while I had my school clothes on. I done this for a week or so but then it became too much. I was then taken back and this time they said they would put me in a social building where they would assess my behavior. We done activities etc. to see how my brain worked and how creative I was. They couldn't find anything apart from the O.C.D and Anxiety I already had. I started to stay in the house almost all day, never went out even with my family. Then they decided I had depression. They put me on medication which I am still on to this day, the medication I felt, didn't really have an effect because my condition was deteriorating.

One year on. I returned to the house and they had found my """"Mystery"""" illness. It was Autism Spectrum Disorder. I again didn't have a clue what this meant but it didn't sound good. I started to do rituals, have communication problems such as eye contact. Just progressively getting worse and worse.

One year down the line to this present day I have never been worse. I have started washing my hands up to 50 times a day. I have difficulty sleeping and the last time I went out with my friends was almost a year ago. I have lost my relationship with my father. We used to play football, go mountain biking, pretty much do everything together but now he won't even speak to me. My brother and mother are the two who care about me the most and I thank them a ton for being there for me but I don't think I have much hope left. I think it's too late for me to put an end to this. I have considered suicide as an option, but that is the easy way out. My family has considered sending me to a mental hospital because they just cannot cope with me anymore. All I can do is wait and be lucky.

"Hi,
I am 17 years old and have suffered from anxiety for a long time and am constantly worried about just about everything and anything eg. someone breaking into my house, travelling abroad. Sometimes that this anxiety gets so much that I end up breaking down and has meant in the past that I have struggled to sleep and have got very upset at sixth form. As well as this I feel the need for things to be done in a particular way and get very upset when things are out of my normal routine.
I also have horrible thoughts about members of my family dying and the need to (usually just before I am about to go to sleep) make a detailed plan of what I would do in each situation. This is something that I struggle to avoid doing despite the fact that it really upsets me.
I haven't really talked to anyone about this before, however it has been suggested quite a while ago that I maybe should talk to the college counseller, but this just makes me more anxious! There is one teacher at college that I am very close to and feel that I can talk to, and I did go through a stage of having to walk past her classroom everyday in order to make me feel less worried about everything even though I wasn't actually speaking to her, I got very distressed if I didn't do this. I find it hard to talk to people because I find myself snappy and grumpy most of the time and I think that this is pulling me away from my friends.
I really don't know what to do and would appreciate any suggestions, thank you","['Thought', 'anxiety', 'anxiety']",0-0,0-0,1-1,Checked
"This is sooo OCD, but I CAN NOT SHAKE OFF THE FEELING.
Last night I was reading my book. It is about sexual abuse. It is a good book about a girl who went threw hell with her dad and is based on a true story. I skipped some pages as I was afraid to get a tingle down there and it just was too much.
I put the book away to sleep and then I started thinking, I enjoy reading this dont I? Its my way to get off instead of porn. I didnt panick and just ignored my thought and said OCD. I then realized a wetness down there and I started wondering if I was wet because I was horny or if it was normal goo from the vagina (sorry!).
I laid in bed and felt I wanted to masterbate, but I didnt as I was afraid that meant the book made me horny so I went to bed. When I woke up this morning I felt really weird. I am unsure if I had a wetdream (if I did it HAS to be because I was horny from the book??!)or if I woke up in the middle of the night wanting to masterbate but didnt cuz I was scared....

"Hi, I am 30 years old and have had OCD most of my life. I have reached the point where I really need help because it is debilitating my life. My thoughts and rituals mostly seem to revolve around fears of death, illness loved ones dying and myself. A lot of this is at night before I go to sleep. 
Anything can trigger it such as not stopping my book on a page that is the same age as a relative as they could die. Not being able to look in the mirror before I go to bed in case that’s the last time I see myself. Not being able to turn off the lights at a time on my phone that matches a terrible event or someone’s age. Having to check everything in the house having to touch nearly everything I come across evenly on both sides a certain amount of times and doing it again if it’s slightly out of time or not even. There’s also a thing with lights and how I have to have a light on for a certain amou tof time. When I go swimming I can only swim certain lengths that are safe numbers and not to do with illness or death.
I could go on and on about everything I do there is so much but it’s realy taking over my life constantly. It doesn’t stop me doing my job or driving my car but it’s this constant anxiety I can’t rid. I have had counselling spoken to people for advice but people always shake it off and say how everyone is OCD and to just stop doing it but I can’t.
I wondered if anyone has similar anxiety to me and do similar things I’ve never read of anyone doing what I do and would love to feel I am not suffering alone.","['Thought', 'Rituals', 'fear', 'OCD', 'anxiety', 'anxiety']",0-0,0-0,1-1,Checked

"Hi, My name is Sophie.
I'm 18, female, English and have not been 'properly' diagnosed with OCD. Since I have never been fully diagnosed, besides my ADHD Dr writing """"OCD?"""" on my report, I have been in denial. I kinda knew I was a 'little OCD', I would joke about it, but its starting to really affect the quality of my life. Perhaps I am just realising to what extent it really affects my life?
I went to my GP weeks ago and they did nothing, going again on monday.
My symptoms are;
What I would call serious skin picking problem. On my legs, my bikini line, my sholders, my arms, my face & my chest. Its so upsetting for me, being an 18 year old girl with 'good skin', I feel like I'm ruining myself. This lowers my self esteem. I go through phases, hardly any skin picking then a huge binge. I feel as if my skin is oily, even if it isn't. This triggers picking. I have even given myself impetigo a few times. I'm so ashamed of my self-induced horrible skin!
Compuslive list writing, this has gotten better but still quite bad. Can spend hours doing this. At one point two years ago my bedroom almost had no floor space due to my ripping out papers because the writing on the list was not good enough. The letters all have to match, be beautiful, no spelling mistakes, which is insane since I am VERY dyslexic.
Organisation is akward for me, going back and forth from ADHD and OCD is tricky, meds help but I think sometimes they make my OCD worse. Things have to be colour coded, untampered with, kept in place, I have to think through where everything goes. Planning pen pots, desk organisation, folder binders.
Most importantly is fears. This affects me the most, Skin picking is second. This is why I am up at 2.50am in the morning writing on this forum. I get fears, illogical fears. It ebs and flows.
Aliens is one I have gotten more recently, not even sure what I am scared of about them (if they even exist?) but it makes it hard for me to sleep, I feel 'unsafe'.
I was in a minor car crash with my boyfriend, since then I have a fear of being in the car and headlights coming towards me.
Heights, stairs, ceiling caving in, somthing falling on me, falling through ceiling or down stairs...ect,ect.
I hate this so much, I just want to be happy again, I'm sick of being scared. I'm crying writing this, I didn't expect to get so emotional. I was always scared of stairs, falling and heights, however these new fears are ruining my life. Sometimes I can talk myself out of them but the feeling is so overwhelming its hard to take control.
What lowers my selfesteem more than anything is the feeling of going/being insane. Not seeming to have control of my actions, getting in my own way. I'm otherwise a very happy person, albeit a little tightly strung.

"Hi Everyone,
This is my first post,
I’m going to my first consultation with a private counselor on Thursday. I have been added to the NHS waiting list about 2 weeks ago, at the same time I finally gave in and have started to take citalopram 10mg. It’s been very hard to accept what that I may actually have a neurological condition - but now I have seemed to have forced myself into accepting it. I have decided that 6 months is too long to wait on an NHS waiting list for CBT; something that I think is probably going to help me recover most effectively. So have taken the plunge and I am going to pay for these sessions privately and attack OCD on 2 fronts.
Obviously this is going to cost me fortune, so I am conscious that I want to get the most of my sessions. I was just looking for advice on how best to enter into these sessions in regards to what to say etc etc etc as I have never been to anything like this before.
In regards to my OCD now I know what it is (mainly to this website and all your great post's) I believe I have had it all of my life. When I think back to any point in my life when I have been truly unhappy it has been down to obsessive internal worrying over illness or horrid thoughts that have gone through my head. I have always managed to get over these, ring fence them and move on.
About 10 months ago I was in a job that I was under a lot of pressure in, working stupid hours and was probably unhappy for the first time in my life for a warranted reason. This brought on a lot of stress and I think this kicked off OCD (is this possible?). I Began to get obsessive thoughts about driving my car into another coming in the other direction, this distressed me to the point where I convinced myself I was suicidal - which quite frankly disgusted me!
Then came the OCD onslaught about suicide, convinced I had depression, convinced I was an alcoholic, self harm in particular regard to sharp knives, hurting others with sharp knives, horrendous vivid images of girls being harmed / mutilated, jumping in front of cars / trains and finally the icing on the cake gay fears OCD. This being what is really affecting me at the minute. The last 6-8 months has been a roller coaster from hell but somehow I am getting there and I’m still kicking :-)
As this is my first post, I would really appreciate a perspective around this. I love cooking it’s a passion and I’ve found it hard to do at points due the OCD around sharp knives. Even now I feel I am beating that strand of OCD, there is def an anxiety scar there. This is similar with the moving object OCD with the notion of me wanting to throw myself in front of things. I walk past moving cars every day and get the train to work, and love driving there is also an anxiety scar with all of these even though they are no longer as prevalent. The OCD about wanting to drive your car into on coming cars has left me not knowing if I will ever be able to drive again or at least an anxiety around it this truly worries and upsets me. Finally, the gay fears OCD that I’m currently going through. I find my mind constantly checking out other blokes even though I know his is ridiculous, but it bothers me to the point of despair and I fel its affecting my libido massively – very mixed up. I love going to the gym - lots of other naked men around obviously this makes this activity sometimes extremely stressful.
So there’s 3 passions that I had in my life a year ago; driving / motor bikes, Cooking and going to the gym and it seems these are the things the OCD has gone for. Is this a coincidence or is this what OCD does???????
Now considering all of the above I would really appreciate some advice on how to move forward with the session on Thursday. I am genuinely excited about seeing this fellow and learning how to manage/overcome my OCD and get on with my life
:-)
Hope to hear from you all
Kind Regards

"I have recently been reading the 4 steps and when I first started it I started to worry because whilst it teaches you to control and over come ocd and live a far more happier life I also got it into my head that we can only learn to control it and live with it and we can never be truly free... this thought plagued me for quite a time however yesterday something happened....
I was sitting outside in the sunshine and as usual my nasty little voice popped into my head and said """"you will never ever be free of this you will live with this forever"""" and in the next second another thought came into my head in exactly the same way the bad thoughts do and it said """"so what, you've already accepted this and your making changes to overcome it, it might always be there but so what"""". I just sat there I was so shocked, I have only ever had bad thoughts pop into my head, I have never had a good one pop in there.
I was and still am so happy, now I feel like there is the little bad ocd voice in my head, the little good encouraging voice and me, and whilst bad ocd voice is very strong, there is no way it can fight both good voice and me forever, the battle has truly begun and we know who is going to win now...

"It's been 2 months since I had thoughts about what if I punched my daughter, and I don't really feel any better. The thoughts for 2 months prior to these were about myself but then the anxiety threw at me one night a thought of what if I hurt my little girl. It has left me in turmoil and no matter what I do I still live with this fear that I will hurt her :-(
Every day is tough, the daytime isn't as bad as the evening, once teatime hits I am anxious and scared to be near her. My head has images of me punching her in the face and fear runs through my body as it feels like it will happen :-( That feeling that it will happen is leaving me in utter turmoil and the reason I am so scared. Thoughts alone are bad but that feeling like it might happen if I go near her is terrible. Is this common? does anyone else feel like this?
I love my daughter so very much, she is 8 and we are so close but the last 2 months have destroyed my relationship with her, I can't be as close to her, or laugh with her like we used to. I can't be alone with her, it really is having a huge impact on my life :-( I have 2 sons that are abit older and the thoughts aren't really about them, they've occasionally hit when near them but very rare.

I have tried to accept them, accept they are a spin off of my anxiety. I had a tough year last year battling anxiety and agoraphobia, I hadn't had OCD before November last year when it suddenly hit me. These last 4 months have been tough but the last 2 months have been the worst as they are about my little girl and I don't want anything bad to happen :-(
The acceptance doesn't help, I am at a loss what to do. I am having ERP/CBT and I have been doing exposure homeworks but we are working up to it slowly, obviously she can't flood me with this just yet as it's high up on my fear hierarchy.We are getting our way up the list though. I have a few things, I removed knives as I had a brief time where i feared sharp objects incase I hurt myself or the children so my psychologist is helping me bring those objects back into the house and making me learn more about my anxiety. It's helping but I am still tortured by this about my little girl every single day and I don't know what to do :-(
I know I have posted before but if anyone could offer me some advice or positive stories I would appreciate it. I am starting to worry the way I feel isn't normal and maybe I don't have OCD :-( I just want to enjoy my family again and be happy. I had a tough year last year after my brother hurt me and my family all took his side, I then developed high anxiety and agoraphobia, things got better and then i was struck down with OCD late last year. I was so happy with my own little family, my husband and our 3 wonderful children, they were all I had and now this OCD is taking my happy place away from me :-(","['joy', 'object', 'fear', 'OCD', 'Thought', 'anxiety', 'anxiety']",0-0,0-0,1-1,checked

I was doing so well, happiest I've ever been.. Until yesterday, I said to myself try not to come back to the forums for my own good, but the urge has become too much, so I'm here with this regrettable thread.
As some of said, which rings true, yes I do fear of getting in trouble and losing my way in life.
The more I dwell on things the worse it appears, I'm in a state again, I'm mentally exhausted.
I am on tablets and have taken part of in some CBT which have taken the edge off fears and I have resumed a happy period.
The situation is really biting at me and before anyone guesses yes! It's is a fear of getting in trouble.
I work in a well established retail environment, surround by all public.
I didn't actually make the mistake this time, but my best mate did!
We were on break in our uniform browsing the store, until a girl was controlling a trolley and nearly hit us, we both laughed as she passed, then he commented, which he thought was quiet, the thing he said was out of order and she looked back in a way that, yes she acknowledged us and what one of us said, now I'm fearing I will get the blame for it.

I met a girl about 2 months ago & have been seeing her since: we have gone on numerous dates. She is really nice, fun,pretty & intelligent. I have had bouts of Gay OCD thoughts but ignored them. I am really keen to meet & have a girlfriend. K is keen to keep things progressing. Anyway, this morning & most of the night I was happy enough sleeping, whereas K wanted to kiss, cuddle etc: she asked why I was being standoffish: long chat: I said I like her and enjoy time, kissing etc,but sometimes I don't quite feel like it: I sometimes question how attracted I am to her, preferred previous girls breasts etc: doubts...doubts... I said maybe if we could take things a bit slower as I find intimacy lovely sometimes, but draining & tiring!! Bloody hell!! Anyway since talk feel bit sad & uneasy: am dying for the intimacy & when I get a hint of it I get lotsof doubts & find it hard to handle.

"Morning everybody
I have 2 questions that are haunting me and I really need to know if there is an answer to either of them
1 Is OCD hereditary?
2 Is paranoia part of OCD
My grandmother was always 'odd'. As I grew up I learned from my parents there was something 'not right' about her. She was a very nasty spiteful woman, but she did have habits that were not 'normal', such as wrapping things in brown paper and tying them with string and hiding them. Then getting them all out each morning and undoing them to check if 'they' had touched anything in the night. Then she would re wrap them and hide them again. She did this evey day. she was always talking about 'them' and what 'they' were plotting to do to her. we never did learn who 'they' were. 'People' were always talking about her, saying things behind her back and laughing at her. 'They' would pump gas through the ceiling to put her to sleep so 'they' could come in and do things. She was totally mistrustful of people and never had any friends.
When I was young my father took delight in telling me I was going to be just like my grandmother, which scared the out of me. but I am like her in a lot of ways and I don't want to be. I'd give anything not to be. But if I am, maybe there is a reason and although she was a very selfish, spiteful and nasty woman and I am not (I don't think ) maybe she was ill but it was just never recognised.
Well, if you are still with me after all that i would appreciate as much feedback on this as poss. as I feel as though I might be on the edge of something.

"So I have recognised myself as having OCD 2 weeks ago today and I said I would post a progress update on here as a kind of therapeutic exercise. It has been a difficult couple of weeks with lots of ups and downs but I feel I am definitely making progress. I feel my days are long and my OCD gets the better of me in the evening time when I get tired and my guard drops a little. It takes alot of energy to fight it.
I said last week that I felt I was feeling 50% better but this might have been slightly exaggerating my progress and there have been some set-backs since. I think the key is coping with set backs. I like monitoring my progress but it is difficult to do because I have trouble remembering exactly how I felt last week. Maybe I should focus less on this.
My main points of progress have been.
Attended 2 social events with minimum anxiety which is good progress for me. Definitely better than a month ago when I couldn't even look people in the eye.
Feel more confident and comfortable in work. Feel more confident doing tasks and feel like I can take on more responsibility
Doubts are less pervasive. They are still strong but I am regaining a better sense of reality.
My focus on other things is improving. I am not constantly preoccupied and I can move a little further away from my OCD.

Purchasing charity OCD-UK Christmas cards not only provides the opportunity for you to financially support the charity, but also in previous seasons we know that many of our members have actually used the cards to gently introduce their family and friends to OCD, a way to come ‘out’ about their OCD in many cases.
We have two new designs for 2009. A more traditional Christmas card scene in ‘Christmas Delivery’ and a more modern look with ‘Frosty the Snowman’.
Christmas Delivery
Frosty the Snowman
Both designs include the seasonal greeting on the inside ‘Best Wishes for Christmas and the New Year’. The cards also include a ‘sold in aid of OCD-UK’ message along with brief charity details. Each pack of Christmas cards are priced at just £3.99 per pack plus postage. Each pack contains ten cards all of the same design, and are made from card derived from sustainable forests.
To order online just click the links above, or visit our online shop by clicking here. If you refer to pay the old fashioned cheque way please use the chat below to work our your postage costs.
For those coming to our conference this year, you can pre order for collection at the conference to save your P+P costs. At £3.99 per pack these are excellent value charity Christmas cards.
Postage:
Unlike other organisations,
we only charge the actual
postage costs incurred by
the charity, so please use
the chart below to calculate
your postage costs:
1 Pack - £0.76
2 or 3 Packs - £1.04
4 to 6 Packs - £2.24
7 to 10 Packs - £2.70
I.e. If you wish to purchase
two packs of cards, then
it will cost £3.99 x 2, plus

It goes without saying, we value our members support and generosity, and we hope our services offer them a little something back. But as you can see, OCD-UK is totally self sufficient, and reliant on the efforts of you, our members.

We had people go to Paris to fundraise and we had people come from Portugal and Germany to fundraise for us, how amazing is that????
I can't thank our members and fundraisers enough, but what I can say is for every £1 you raised, it helps keep OCD-UK afloat. Without your efforts we would have to close.
2011 will be a tough year for the charity as £17,000 of the income this year came from the London Marathon which we do not have places for in 2011, so we need to somehow get more people involved in the events we do have places for. I am delighted to say that we have signed up our first two fund-raisers for events in 2011 and I have also signed up for two 10K runs as part of my 10x10 challenge.

1. it costs an ABSOLUTE fortune being me, my mum and dad buy most of my products whihc include loads of sprays, soap, wipes, shampoo and electricity cause of useing the shower.
2. because i spray my body so much with disinfectant i have dry skin and sometimes it goes red raw and burns so much, like right now i can hardly walk cause of sprayin my feet the joints at the bottom of my toes are all red and its stingy and hard to walk. i sprayed my underwear once to and my inner thighs went all red and i was crying i couldnt sleep i thought i was gona go into septic shock!!
3. it prevents u goin out cause if u do go out u have to get changed and spray ureself again!.
4. medication and depression makes u sleepy so i slept lots and hardly went into uni so i failed this year and im not goin back
5. ure parents get fed up with u and deep down they no theyd rather not have u in the house cause u cant let them live the way they want to and u ruin everything.
6. because i dont care about germs in the way that most contamination people do like there afraid of gettin ill or gettin other people ill, i belive its harder to get rid of mine cause mine is based on facts and logic i supose, even my physcologist says yes there is logic in it so its harder to get rid of i think anyway.

I guess we are all looking for some support in trying to better understand OCD. I am a mom of two. My 9 year old daughter has just been diagnosed with OCD. We are awaiting our referral to PE CAMHS. It would be great to hear from other parents in what has worked for them with children of a similar age. I have yet to sit down and properly discuss with my daughter what OCD means. I guess I am really trying to get my own head around it first. My daughter does excessive hand washing, hops four times probably 20 times a day; constant sighing; constant sniffing; poor memory; won't go upstairs by herself; a constant worryier and also has short term memory difficulties. She was diagnosed with dyslexia and dyscalculia when she was 7 and we are working on that but I know that causes her self doubt and anxiety. I separated from her father when she was little but that has also caused emotional issues.
Would love to hear from parents who are helping their child to cope with OCD stuff and what you do for yourself to come to peace with it.
Good luck to all.

"Hi everyone
Just checking in with a progress report.
I'm checking the switches at night less - still checking them a little but the urge is falling away and things aren't quite as bad in that department. I'm able to settle down quicker and had a good night's sleep.
This morning, though, was another story. I had to wake up early because of people who are coming to look at the house but I've been stuck in my room all morning with old worries on my plate. I know it sounds awful, but I look into my past, at the vivid thoughts I've had before that might not have all been OCD, for 'ruining' past moments of triumph - and for tripping myself up in the relieved aftermath when I realised I was suffering from depression - and although they haven't stopped me doing anything, I still feel so guilty for having them - for 'allowing' them essentially and not doing anything about them. I didn't want to just write them off because I didn't want to be arrogant. I don't want to 'assume' things and be over-confident; I don't want to just think 'Oh, everything's fine.'
I finally took out the Meditation CD that came with the Mindfulness book and did the first meditation which calmed me a little. I also read the book and came across a passage to do with guilt, that really struck a chord with me, because I felt a lot of what the list described. The trouble was I started to act erratically, trying to force my mind into distraction and basically starting to move and think too fast.
In other parts of my life, things have been picking up - I still feel somewhat sad and had a little weep last night - but I've been sending out more job applications and getting responses and have had a couple of offers for interviews, which has been heartening. I've started to pay more attention to my writing as well. I think things took a turning point when I joined this new creative writing society, because I met new people and it was a welcome change to the tedium.
So, that's where I am at the moment. I really don't want to run myself down, but it's just been one of those mornings when I've had to stay out of my parents' way because they've had other things on their minds and then my Mum got wound up over something with my brother, and I've just been a bit isolated and trying rather too hard to tackle my fears by attempting to 'disprove them.'

"Hi all.
Well *points upwards* yes. Today was difficult. I wrote a lot of my worries down at work in my little journal, just to offload, but I just fancied a chat here. 
I don't quite know what happened today - though I suspect a bad night's sleep didn't help - but I felt very depressed for most of the day. I was on my own a lot and just had all this stuff in my head. I felt alone. I've been having trouble getting along; I struggled at my writer's group last night and some of my friends noted I was distant. I just couldn't 'click in.' I feel very afraid that I'll never get the right help.
In particular, I am STILL even now questioning my own behaviour. I cannot look certain people in the eye because I still get horrid thoughts about them and I'm scared they will know. I can't shake those thoughts off and I want to run away from them and hide. I just don't understand why I still feel like this. I'm so frightened. I just don't know how yo cope and how can I pay attention and engage if I can't look them in the eye? I know a thought is a thought. But I am very, very afraid. It's the staff Christmas party tomorrow and everyone else is really excited. But I feel overwhelmingly negative and like I've given up trying.

"Hey guys. I've been doing 'okay' lately. Yes it's a struggle every day and I really mean that it is so hard getting through every day....but I've been having more up or coping moments lately....been more chatty, etc and not as desperately depressed when I wake up usually. Sleeps been better some of the time. Ive started CBT and I like the therapist and usually after I feel alright.
I've been trying to implement some of the coping strategies and didn't do too bad at the wknd...sometimes I still felt bad but managed to work through it....been trying to ignore the thoughts and effectively relabel them.
But todays been really bad....its like all the coping goes out the window...I feel guilty, responsible...haven't been able to postpone my worrying til 'worry time' which Ive just been trying these past few days....Ive been analysing over and over. The thoughts and feelings I get just seem so real sometimes and it's horrible....I suffer from relationship type ocd and it's just horrible. It feels like you can't recover after having a bad day.....Ive come home and cried my eyes out to my boyfriend....I haven't cried so much for ages.
Can I ask your advice about the medication. Yes I have my appetite back, yes my sleep is better sometimes, and yes Im becoming more chatty etc usually....but I am worried about the medication I feel like I just want to STOP it tonight. I worry that it's worsening my ocd...can it do that...can it numb feelings and make thoughts seem more real or is this just the ocd. Im just really worried about what to do....on the one hand I do't want to be massively depressed again AND still have the same thoughts/feelings I get now cos that would be much worse....but I don't feel I can put up with things like this at the moment.....Im on 30mg citalopram....I sometimes feel 'weird' like in a bit of a daze if this makes sense. I just get scared that medication can mess up your emotions and stuff.......
What side effects can you get from just stopping it? I feel like just stopping it and seeing how I feel but Im scared im gonna feel worse.....its a catch 22 situation....feel bad with it, feel bad without it.

I'm sorry, everyone. I feel I've reached the end of the line.

"Hello,
I've been away from the boards for a while (too long). Things have been very up and down for me. I came off my medication (Sertraline) quite a while ago - a decision that I'm glad I made and want to stick to, but although I have OCD in my life every day, sometimes it gets really bad and I feel awful - scared, sick, worthless and anxious.
Most days I cope ok (I've had OCD since childhood) but yesterday and today I'm really struggling, so I really hope someone on here can relate to what I'm saying. I feel like such a freak. A total loser.
Basically, the way my OCD works is that I have terrible, nasty or violent thoughts about bad things happening to the people that I love.
When I was little, I would do anything I could to stop my mum from dying. This was related to contamination fears.
The I became OBSESSED with symbols and old carvings, religious pictures and anything I believed that had 'power'. I would believe that these symbols, etc could read my mind and make my bad thoughts come true because they were powerful.
Now I have this scary intrusive thought that I can't shake off. I feel scared writing it in case you all think I am a sick and bed person (maybe I am. I certainly feel like one). But here goes...
My intrusive thought goes 'Pray to the devil' then I think about bad things happening to the people I love. I then believe that these thoughts have the power to make the bad things I thought happen. Therefore I believe that I am cursing the people that I love.
This is just too much for me to deal with - these thoughts pop into my mind at ANY time - when I am happy, sad, reading, watching TV....
I am constantly living with the burden that people I love will be harmed because of my terrible, nasty thoughts.
I am a bad person and I feel worthless.

"Hello All,
Yesterday I had my physical with my new GP. I have met her once before and she seemed kind enough and like a good doctor. I have nervous issues with getting my yearly exam, due to my PTSD, and I had made plans to bring my SO with me.
During the consult portion of the visit I mentioned I was considering going off of my meds- (Lexapro-escitalopram). I told her that when I first started taking them I was told by my psychiatrist it would not be forever and I have had serious weight gain. Now, I admit I have always been a bit bigger and do not exercise as one should because of my fibromyalgia but I have gained near 5 stone in the last two years!! It is taking a toll on me physically and mentally.
Her response was that I should not come off the meds because she is afraid I will become suicidal- something I have not been in 10-15 years- despite being unmedicated. She also said and I quote """"I don't want you getting all suicidal and not being able to get a job. He (meaning my SO) will just get so frustrated and say 'I am out of here'.""""
I was awestruck at the callousness of her remark- Did she really just say that my SO would leave me if I went off my meds?? Did she really just assume that she somehow knew the dynamic of our relationship? Has she even looked at my charts from my old doctors!!!!
I was so upset that I just shut up and listened to her babble on about switching to Prozac by adding the Prozac for 3-4 weeks and then taking away the Lexapro. I said I would think about it.
Here is where I am torn. I would normally just say off and get a new doctor but physically she has been really helpful and is even trying to get me into a pain clinic for the fibro- if my insurance will cover it. She also located a lump yesterday and I have to go for a mammogram. All in all a VERY upsetting visit.
I just do not know what to do??? Do I keep seeing her, do I find a new doctor? Do I say something to her about how much she upset us? My SO's blood was boiling, he held his tongue but was turning bright red in the face and white knuckled.

i just want to say a big sorry to everyone that has helped me over the last few months, im sure u must be sick of me and tired of me going round and round in circles
Alot of the time i honestly dont realise i am or seeking reasurrance. Only since Scooby pointed this out to me that it has started to make sense and i feel like a fool.
I have been finding the OCD/Anxiety very hard over the last few months, i have good days like all of us, but when i have a hard one its REALLY hard.
And coming here is like a sacntury for me as i am not alone, i feel bad that i have been asking for reassurance on subjects alot of the time but i really didnt mean to.
Im thinking i should visit/post less as i am worried about what i post now incase it is reassurance.
I had a great group session today at CBT (last one in 2 weeks) and we did alot of work on my thoughts, and worked though our thought diaries. I learnt alot today,
I mentioned when i was there that everything seems sooo clear when they talk through things with me, facing up to the fears etc and looking at the evidence for and against the thought.
But when i am alone and feeling low i do tend to struggle and the hard work does vanish. I need to just keep on top of this i guess and keep working on it.
So i just want to say thanx again to everyone, and i wish / hope i can help people here as much as they have helped me.
much love to all!

I am being put on the waiting list for cbt but dose anybody know how long i will be waiting for?
I have also been put on citloapram 20 mg to start with as i have also been diagnosed with depression on tiop of my ocd.

"I really want to thank all the Mods, Legend, Teddybear and all the other members that have offered me advice / guidence this week.
I have had a VERY tough week with my thoughts (worst ever) and they have been on heavy rotation,I have really been convincing myself that i am dying of AIDS and Diabetes.
I think this is because my depression is quite bad atm and i am very anxious about a job interview next week (first one in 2 years)
Also been very anxious as im still waiting for more news from my referal etc
But you guys have REALLY helped and i do appreciate it ALOT.
I am feeling a tad better today and have realised that i need to take each day as it comes.
I have just started reading a book called """" STOP THINKING START LIVING"""" By Richard Carlson and i highly reccomend it to other people who are having a tough time with there obsessive thoughts. I got this on Play.com

To Ashley, for starting this place, and for giving me a second chance. I know I didn't deserve one, but you gave me one anyway, and I appreciate it so, so much.
To PolarBear, for his knowledge gained through years of strife, and for his tough love. I know we've butt heads on occasion, but I do appreciate your input. More than you know.
To SnowBear, who always manages to explain things in soothing terms. The only person who can reassure without reassurance. Making the scary seem okay. That's a rare gift.
To my friends: Taurean, JimAngie1973, KittyPurry, and Alisando123 for their support and camraderie.
To Gemma, for helping me earlier.
To everybody, really. If it weren't for you all, I'd be hurt, scared, lost.
But I'm not. Thanks to you all.
I don't know if I can accurately convey my gratitude. Just know that this place, and the people here, have probably saved my life. You may very well have saved a life. Be proud of that.
I love you all. So, so much.

I just wanted to say that even though I may not be on here as much for the moment in time, I'd just like to say thank you to everybody who has been there when I've been having my rough days and when I was constantly doubting. You have all be so kind and supportive and without your help and support I don't think I would of been able to cope at all. I'm not saying I am cured, because I'm certainly not that but I am learning new techniques to take away the thought. I've found not reading the new and all those horrid stories has helped and just keeping myself busy more. But once again I thank all of you for your kindness and supportiveness and helping me out when I've been in a bit of a rough spot. It's means so so much

Your replies got me through work today. This morning I was tearing my hair out, I didn't think I would cope.

"Hello, I realize I probably should have introduced myself when I first joined, but better late than never, right? Firstly I'd like to say that I am so glad that I found this site, and thank you for being so supportive and for being such lovely people!
Looking back, I think that I probably developed OCD when I was 9 or 10. I had all sorts of crazy rituals, like racing around the kitchen trying to touch all the counter tops before the refrigerator door closed, otherwise something terrible would happen. Unfortunately, I don't think my mom knew not to indulge my reassurance seeking, so I often went to her confessing my thoughts and worries. After some unsuccessful therapy and taking medication for a couple years, OCD left me alone for a while. Now it seems to be back to bully me some more. I'm now a junior in high school, and since I'm facing some pretty big changes next year in addition to regular stress from school, I'm hoping that the OCD will go away once the stress does. But this is probably (most likely) just wishful thinking. Well, if you've read this far, thanks!","['Rituals', 'kitchen', 'Thought', 'Medication', 'OCD', 'site']",0-0,0-0,1-1,Checked 
"Hi I wrote a post last week on my experience when I reduced10 ml citraplam ,so went from 40 to 30 .
I was typing form my mobile and don't think I explained things properly and I still concerned about these new thoughts I am having . They don't have any pocd content which is what I normally suffer from they stopped or just these new thoughts drowned them out . This is what I feeling / hearing and I want to know is this normal .
Slowed reaction when people asked me questions making me frustrated and nervous
Daydreaming or being somewhere else and find it hard to hear concentrate on what my parterner was saying.
Not being to feel happy or excited , we heading out with friends and jus wanting my usual self as I love my socialising . Couldn thinking of things to chat about and I am normally a wee chatterbox .
Very usual experience , what the hell was it all about ? I stuck this for 2 weeks and felt myself slipping into that wee hole I don't like and went back on my 40ml citraplam and now I am fine .

"Hi guys,
We're going to travel up north for my uncle's funeral next week and I'm a bit worried about the journey and the B&B.
This is because:
- I can't really use public toilets and service station loos in particular are impossible (last time I was going to do exposure work by using one I saw a little girl coming out of the loo with puke all down her t-shirt, then she puked on the floor of the service station!)
- I'm anxious in case anyone throws up in the car (my gran does get car sick sometimes).
- I'm worried about the B&B being dirty as we can't afford to stay anywhere nice.
- I'm concerned in case there's some sort of buffet thing afterwards and my family get norovirus from whoever prepared it
- I'm worried that someone at the actual funeral might say they've had a sickness bug recently
What should I do? I think I should go and I want to but I'm stressed!

"Well that's an understatement. I'm confused all the time!
I'm going to have an operation soon on a very bad varicose vein in my right thigh and as part of the pre assessment I had to write down my medical history. Today I got a letter confirming that the surgeon will be offering surgery after I have had an xray to find out the cause of the protruding veins. My letter was a copy of the letter he sent to my gp.
In my letter he said also that he had noted my medical history, including the fact that I have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. I'm just wondering why he wrote that in the letter to my gp. Does he think I'm going to 'flip' while in hospital? Or am I reading too much into it? I just wondered why he would have written that. I don't want my gp thinking that I'm attention seeking by having written down that I have OCD.

"Hi peeps
I don't post in this forum much these days, mainly because I can't think of a single useful thing to say that's going to help anyone.
Anyway, so I'm sorry to be offloading again here, but am feeling a bit wiped out and a bit down tbh with you.
It's coming to the end of term at college - the end of a very long two years for me, in July I graduate and hopefully get my PGCE (I say hopefully - more on that later). I've got about three weeks left until I finish, and my workload is off the scale. On top of all my coursework I've got all my students to think about - and two lots of assignments to mark (about 30 pieces of coursework), plus all the lesson planning and final admin to do. It seems like once I get one bit done - I find something else that I've not done, or not completed or someone else drops an extra load of work on me.
I'd supposedly finished my 5,000 word research project this afternoon - gone back to check over what I've done and realised I've left a load of important stuff out of it - and it's got to be handed in Monday. I just don't have time to sort it now.
On top of all that, the LEA lost all my original finance forms - had to refill them all in, and was told that I woudn't be able to graduate until December. I got them all organised and this week was told I'd be able to get my results - great news - but now I've decided that I can't face going to the graduation ceremony because of the way I look. The last time I graduated was in 2001, and I was shall we say - a lot heavier than I am now - was really quite overweight and podgy, and now I'm almost 4 stone lighter and looking hideous, I just can't face the cap and gown shenanigins - plus the remarks from my folks on how bad I look. My Dad's already made a few remarks here and there about how much difference there is between me then and me now.
So although I'm gonna be finished soon, it just doesn't feel like it - it feels neverending, like the final mountain is just too much, and that I'm really slipping again. Been feeling a bit off since I did my teaching on Wednesday - nothing that I can put my finger on, just tired, down, extremely headachy and depressed.
I know I have to do it, but I think it's gonna finish me off. I feel very unprepared to be a 'proper' teacher, very unprepared for what lies ahead of me and wondering whether I'm trying to do something that's not right for me. I'm not sure I can cope with the OCD and being a teacher. I don't think I'm strong enough.
I know there's folks on here with far more serious issues and problems than me so I'll shut up now and go away. Just needed a rant really.","['drop', 'overweight', 'OCD', 'hope']",0-0,0-0,1-1,Checked 
"well, i had my teeth taken out on friday under sedation and all went well, still a bit painful but all seems to be healing nicely.
have decided to have them replaced as eating is now a major chore and it's causing all kinds of issues, like fear of knocking out remaining teeth etc.
phoned the dentist this morning to make an appointment to discuss dentures and other options and they managed to get me an appointment today, so i went. i thought we would just sit and talk about it and then i could make a decision, but when i got there they put me in the chair and had a good look etc which freaked me out a bit (dentist was very good, knows about my ocd, was really gentle and talked me through it all), when he finished he told me that it all looked good and that there was no infection which i was pleased about, then he went through my options, implants, which are a no no due to cost and pain and fear of dental treatment, bridge, but again would mean working on the teeth either side and he knows i wont do it due to having to go back and have mouth numbed etc so would mean sedation again which means going private which is really expensive so it was decided that best option is dentures. i liked the idea of that (makes me feel old though) as it means no pain or work to be done. once we decided it i thought he would tell me to make another appointment to get it started but he didn't, he did the moulds then and there. i hated it coz it made me gag, tasted horrid and meant putting that blue plasticine stuff in my mouth. again he was really good and now i have 3 more appointments and then i will have all my teeth again. but i'm really freaking out because i have to go back again and i'm worried that it will all go wrong. i'm worried also that the blue mould thing might have loosened my teeth or infected my mouth where the teeth had been taken out. i haven't eaten all day coz i'm so worried about my teeth coming out.
i keep thinking that i should just cancel the appointments and go without teeth because i deserve it, my brain keeps telling me that all this happened because i'm a bad person. like bad karma coming back on me.
i feel really down, like i'm really ugly now coz of my teeth and it's all my fault.","['OCD', 'Treatment', 'fear', 'Thought']",0-0,0-0,1-1,Checked 
"Sorry guys, this is probably way too much information, but need some advice.....not reassurance.....advice.
I've just been with my 3-year-old daughter to visit my elderly grandmother who is in a care home.
She has a room to herself and her own bathroom, whilst we were there my little girl needed to use the toilet......
I noticed there were dubious """"stains"""" on the seat, and I know that my gran was given something to """"help her along"""" this morning as she's had problems going to the toilet (you can do the maths) :blushing:
Anyway I lifted the seat, because I didn't want my little girl sitting on it, but she had a right tantrum and pulled the seat down - touching said stains as she did.......she then went right ahead and sat on the seat, on the stains......
I washed her hands when she'd finished, but not as thoroughly as I'd have liked because she's 3, and wouldn't keep still.
She has now sat in her car seat and all over my sofa in the clothes she was wearing at the time (so now I think everything is contaminated) because I didn't want to stick her in the bath straight away......because then the ocd would have won right?
My stomach has been a in a knot ever since, my mind has gone into overdrive with all the possible diseases she could catch.
I spoke to my hubby, who is usually the yardstick I go by.....(if he's not worried then it must be ocd) and even he seemed a bit grossed out. Which has made me even worse.
So is this ocd? Or am I right to be concerned?
Why does it always happen to me??????

"This article was written by Dr Stephanie Fitzgerald and was first published during OCD Awareness Week, October 2011.
A bit like that? Combatting the myth about Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.
As a Clinical Psychologist working with people affected by Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), there are six words that for me epitomise the level of ignorance that exists around OCD: â€˜Oh, Iâ€™m a bit like thatâ€™. Weâ€™ve all heard someone say them. Whether itâ€™s someone referring to the fact they like a tidy desk at work, or someone talking about how grim some festival toilets were, weâ€™ve all heard someone discuss how they can be â€˜a bit OCD about things like thatâ€™.
OCD, in this misunderstood form, seems to have become a very popular disorder. People view OCD as a quirky character trait meaning you like things done in a certain way, or in a certain order, or have your own routine which you are fond of and like to stick to. Alternatively, due to the mediaâ€™s insistence as portraying OCD as an addiction to hand-washing and an intolerance of germs, OCD is viewed as an almost positive character trait. People believe by declaring themselves as â€˜a bit OCDâ€™ they are proudly declaring that they keep their home neat and tidy. Indeed nowadays it seems that people seem to aspire to have OCD and are very keen to tell others â€˜Oh, Iâ€™m a bit like thatâ€™.
I wonder whether these people would still be keen to say they are a bit like that if they truly understood OCD? If by saying â€˜Oh, Iâ€™m a bit like thatâ€™ they knew they were admitting to thoughts of harming a loved one, anxiety about driving because they believed they had run someone over, or harbouring such fears about contamination that they would be unable to hug their own child? OCD seems to have become an illness that those without it feel comfortable laughing about, as demonstrated by the recent release of an â€˜OCD Chefâ€™ chopping board which features precise measurement lines for â€œfinicky foodiesâ€ and a claim that â€˜it is anti-bacterial so doesnâ€™t need scrubbing 11 times to make sure itâ€™s cleanâ€™. Hilarious. I wonder when did we decide it was ok to laugh at people who are having their lives ruined by an anxiety disorder? People who struggle alone for years and, when they finally get the courage to tell friends and colleagues, have their anxieties dismissed as â€˜oh, Iâ€™m a bit like that tooâ€™?
As part of raising awareness for OCD it is important to dispel this myth about OCD somehow being a positive life-style choice. Those with OCD will be able to tell people just how tough it is- and they should. It is only by those with OCD finding the courage to share their experiences and raise awareness about what OCD actually looks and feels like that people will learn it is no laughing matter. I work hard to dispel the myths around OCD, but I find that my role tends to be supporting and guiding those who are aware of their own OCD towards effective treatment. However there is a much wider issue of public perception that needs addressing. Until people stop viewing OCD as a positive character quirk, we will be unable to move towards greater recognition and support for those individuals and their families who are affected.
I have had so many interesting conversations with people when Iâ€™ve overheard them say something inaccurate or jokey about OCD and the biggest response I get from people is total surprise. People just simply do not know or appreciate just how complex and severe a condition OCD is and itâ€™s about time they knew. I plan to use this awareness week to talk to as many people as possible about the realities of OCD and what they can do to help raise awareness. I see this week as a fantastic opportunity and I know we can get a really positive message across about how important it is to help those affected by OCD. But maybe thatâ€™s just me. Because, you know, Iâ€™m just a bit like that.

i have always been a bit of an extrovert. Even as an eleven year old I remember sticking bouncy balls down my top to make people laugh and my friends being too scared to. Yet I am also quite shy and can be socially awkward!! It's like when comedians are funny to cover their shyness. I'm also very soft hearted and a bit of a geek. Yet sometimes when I go out I wear low cut tops (naturally big chested) and blonde hair extensions as I like looking glamourous and sexy. But I feel like I am attracting the wrong guys. I feel like they expect me to be a loud blonde bimbo. I'm actually into Harry Potter and geeky stuff like that lol. So I feel lost. I see pictures of myself and I think is this really me? Sometimes I think I wear all the make up and low cut stuff to make myself seem pretty as I don't feel pretty naturally. I worry that I won't attract a nice guy as I am portraying myself wrong. But at the same time I like the Glamourous look. so I feel confused who I am. I feel I should either be a geek with dark hair or a bimbo with blonde hair big boobs. I'm lost so how can I attract someone when I don't even know who I am??!! Would a nice guy be able to see past my outer mask and see I am vulnerable and nice deep down? Or should I change myself? I don't know if this is ocd related but I am unsure who I am and it makes me anxious so I think it might be. Sorry to go on xx,['OCD'],0-0,0-0,1-0,Checked
"Last night I was out and when I went back to my car I stepped in something brown and mushy that was on the road. It has been wet and the temperature warmer than usual so there is a lot of ice and puddles and general muck about.
This area of the city is, sadly, a popular area for dog fouling so naturally my head went there. Regular readers of my diatribes will also know that I have fairly terrible luck when it comes to this and it is a top fear of mine. In this case I couldn't be sure but I expected the worst.
I wiped my feet on some ice, got in my car, and proceeded to take my child to her moms place.
However, after dropping off my daughter I decided I wanted to be sure whether or not it was dog fouling. That way I could decide how I was going to deal with it. So...
I then went back, half way across the city, armed with some wooden sticks and some hand wipes. I found the spot where I'd parked, got out, and inspected the mess I had stepped in. Lucky for me it turned out to be a wad of papers covered in road grime but flattened to the point of being unrecognizable mush until I pulled it apart.
So... This incident has a lot of questions attached to it. Admittedly I don't see a lot of people inspecting detritus on the ground in the dark night with a pair of chopsticks. I am glad nobody saw me. Was it okay to make sure that it was or was not dog fouling? Am I supposed to assume it was and NOT do anything? Am I supposed to assume it was and then proceed like I did last month when it DID happen and wind up with new shoes, new car mats, and wipe the pedals? Was it even remotely good to face the fear of what it could have been and inspect it?
When I did CBT years ago one of the issues was my exwife and her family were going to bathe my daughter in water that was not safe to drink. I was told by my therapist that it was not OCD to find out what was wrong with the water and to get advice from the local health department (who agreed with me that it was not safe to bathe my daughter in the bad water, but I digress). Is checking this (once) in the same vein?

"Today my friend and I were talking and we somehow got on to the subject of being organised and tidy, she was saying how she loves a good tidy, and we giggled over how funny we can both be at having things 'just the way we like them...' and she said 'yeah it's a bit ocd of me...'
Also another of my friends said before that she likes colour co-ordinating things and gets 'really ocd' about it.
What do you guys make of this? I can't decide if I am actually a bit offended, because I keep thinking, yes but you DON'T have ocd, and you have no idea how awful it really is - it's not just being tidy or liking things in a certain order, it's the whole mentality and experience of the world that goes with it, how you have to think in a certain way and you can't do things, and it's draining. Or am I being harsh, because as it has been said before, everyone can be said to be somewhere on the ocd spectrum, but just not to the extent that it is with some of us...
I just don't know how to take it, especially as this girl didn't know I have ocd... do I say, well actually I have ocd and it's like this... or just smile and let it go. She was laughing about it, I don't know maybe I'm just being oversensitive, but it seems people who don't really know much about it assume that if they like things neat and tidy, or have a little quirk, it is 'quite ocd', and also, that it's really funny. It's also just the wrong phrasing of the term that gets me, how can you be really ocd?? you HAVE ocd, you can't BE ocd I'm getting het up over nothing aren't i? I just wondered what you thought, and also your views on what you would reply? I know I shouldn't be but I can get pretty embarrassed talking about it with people who don't understand.
(I told the girl with the colour co-ordinating thing, that I had been diagnosed, and she looked really doubtful, and said 'really? That's a strange diagnosis! What about you is ocd?' arrrggghhhhhhhhh)

"Hello everybody 
I haven't been here in awhile, as since I've increased my medication, my ocd and overall mood as been better than ever. I find that the best way of describing it is that I felt that my head was filled with dark, grey clouds and now there's some sunshine coming through.
The only side effect I've experienced is weight gain. A lot. Some days I struggle with it and other days I'm fine, since it is a decent tradeoff for having a manageable ocd. 
However, my mother is a very superficial person and we don't get along that well. She keeps trying to put me on diets, she even got me an appointment with a nutritionist against my will, she keeps pressuring me to go on walks with her, etc. On the one hand I get what she's doing, but on the other hand, she's not doing it for my wellbeing. She just doesn't want to have a fat kid. She told me I was too young to get fat. I'm 22, 1.57m tall and I weigh 60kg. I used to weigh about 50kg before I started medication. 
All she cares about is looks and how men view her. I couldn't give a ****. I've always been single and I'd rather be alone then having to rely on men to be happy. We are on two ends of the spectrum and we've always had our differences.
I don't eat badly and would rather not have to go on diets. I find that unlike before, the medication makes it much harder to lose weight. On my last appointment I thought about telling my psychiatrist, but ended up not to and now that I can finally feeling positive side effects, I don't know if I should... I take pregabalin and paroxetine, as well as gabapentin for migraines.

  I'm having a bit of a struggle today so I thought I'd write down what happened and how I'm going to deal with it. Sorry if some of it is a bit gross, I won't go into too much detail. Any ideas or suggestions are welcome.
  I managed to block my toilet badly enough that it backed up and contaminated my shower, and I don't mean OCD contamination, I mean obviously dirty water. Fortunately I have another bathroom I can use to have a shower, although I had to clean it first because I haven't used it for nearly two years. I haven't been able to go to work today, because the best I can do at the moment is try to calm down and understand that nothing too bad has happened and I am perfectly clean after my shower.
  After that I'm going to do some chores and get myself sorted so I can go back to work tomorrow, and then I'm going to use this as a kickstart to make some progress with sorting out my house. I wan't to able to have people visit my house again and I want to really beat this OCD because I'm getting fed up with it now. Thanks for reading.","['Thought', 'toilet', 'bathroom', 'OCD']",0-0,0-0,1-1,checked 
"Hi guys,
Forgive me if I have mentioned/asked this before. I did check before I posted but I can't see anything, so if I have, please excuse me :original:
I just wondered whether anyone elses' OCD sort of 'interrupts' with conversation? I was diagnosed with Pure O earlier this year and sometimes I find my OCD kind of buts in if I'm talking (truthfully, that's most times ). Sometimes, it'll want me to say something like """"right, and now to kill you"""" after a conversation. It causes me some panic but not a lot, probably because I'm 99% sure it's OCD and I can sort of use my inner conscience to give it that disapproving look, so this is really just to see whether anyone else finds this, or whether my OCD is a bit of an oddball!
Obviously, it's a bit scary because that bit of me starts with the """"what if?"""" thoughts. Flipside to that I see those for what they are, anxiety and panic. I know some OCD sufferers believe they are schizophrenic, so maybe it's a bit like that? I know I'm not, I know these thoughts are my own, but the are sort of the total opposite to what I want to say and, obviously, they distract me from what I really meant to say!
Also, does anyone find """"breakfast tea"""" to make anxiety worse? I've read in several places some teas help, but I find breakfast tea to be one of the worst! I get that huge surge of adrenaline, flap about for an hour or two, panic a bit more, burn out, sleep...then I'm OK!
I have just had a kind of stressful few hours as my neighbours kicked off again and the stray moggy's momma turned up, quite a lot to deal with when anxiety has it's claws in you. I am doing my best to focus on the here and now (not too much to do, I am doing X task etc) but it's hard to keep it up, it does take time.
Just throwing it out there anyway, I know about awfulizing and what if thoughts and so on, but I've never known those sort of thoughts. Anyone else? I wouldn't be surprised if I'm the odd one out! Story of my life! Lol

"Hi my name is Nicky been an OCD sufferer for 11 years this is my 1st relapse happened 4 weeks ago heres a tip ive found helpful, When you get that 'thought' allow it in, breathe deeply, tell yourself that it is NOT your thought it's an OCD thought and dont connect/engage with it just let it be, even if the content is scary, remember its your OCD pattern of thinking, it will throw allsorts of themes and added thoughts to it to upset you and get you to analyse it. Dont give in to it, it doesnt reflect YOU as a person, if you were that person you wouldnt worry about it you would find it pleasant and you certainly wouldnt be on here looking for REASSURANCE. This has helped me from looking up NHS OCD information pages, peoples experiances and many other self help. Its helped me loads. Thoughts havent gone (they wont) and will be worse some days depending on environmental factors, body feeling factors I.e anxiety, hormones, heat and stress, you have to BELIEVE IN YOURSELF and know only you are in control of your body no one or anything else.

"Hello,
I hope everyone is having a good January so far.
Until last week I hadn't been to the cinema (something I love doing) for a long time for fear of contamination. I've also avoided public places for the past few months because of the norovirus outbreak.
On Wednesday I went to see a film with my family- I thought we were going to a 'safe' town but we ended up going to a town where I knew there has been a norovirus outbreak (the local hospital had two wards closed down a couple of weeks ago). I was petrified about the whole thing!
When we got there I didn't want to go in and noticed a vomit-like wet patch on the carpet near the loos (Mum thought it looked like a leak from the loo- which was worse!) so I was even more determined to leave. I went and sat in the car but then decided to watch the film- I actually thought we were 80% likely to catch norovirus!
On the negative side I still can't use public toilets so was very worried about needing the loo and I couldn't eat because I didn't want to put my hands anywhere near my face so I'll have to work on those two things (and try not to forbid my family from using the loos next time). I also made everyone use loads of anti-viral foam so that's another thing to reduce and I showered for about an hour afterwards so I guess it wasn't that amazing!. It's tricky to describe how traumatic a normal activity like that can be when you have contamination worries but anyway I'm glad I got through it!
Today I'm worried because there was a bit of dry tissue on the living room floor. I think it looked like a little rolled up bit of public-toilet loo roll (the thin, cheap stuff) and that it might have been on the back of someone's shoe. The cat lay on it and I'm worried about her lying on my family member's beds (I leave my door shut). Is this very silly?

I never really post on here asking for help because I would like to think that I help other people, a bit like a Dear Marmite.....
I can concerntrate on others rather than myself :blushing:
I have my very first meeting tomorrow with a mental health team to see if I need referring for CBT.
I absolutely know that I need CBT but it's whether I manage to convince them that I need it. Jeez how bad does that sound? It sounds like I'm going to lie because I want CBT. Honestly that not how it is.
I am really trying to help myself since I went up to 150mg of clomipramine 6 weeks ago.
I have managed to put my daughters to bed at night only telling them once what we do if someone breaks into the house at night, which is one of my worst fears.
Anyway any little bit of support I would be very very grateful for.

"Hmmm. Been doing well recently but realised that I still actually avoid a lot of places due to OCD.
I like to think I'm coping fine because I work and have a very fruitful social life, creative outlets etc...
But I still find it almost impossible to walk through a large open space or sit in a park. My Girlfriend raised the park thing the other day and said it was a source of great sadness to her.. :-(
Guilt... wonderful.
The agoraphobic thing is an utter horrid by product of my 'thoughts.'
For all the mechanisms I have in place for my Pure-O I just can't manage as well when I'm sleep deprived; today I'm supposed to wander over to Shepherds Bush station, get on the tube, change once and get off at Waterloo where I'm meeting my GF to go to Bournemouth.
Now before I even get into how many triggers there might be on the South Coast, the trip to Waterloo is intimidating me massively. Even the walk to the station will be hard today and I don't wanna run there like a loon... I'll get triggers on the tube platform and worse to come if I have to wait too long for the next train at Bond St. When I get to Waterloo I'm going to feel terrified and fenzied; that station is an utter trigger for me and I don't know how I'm gonna manage. I'd like to get my GF to meet me somewhere right next to the tube so at least I'm with her when I walk across the big open Concourse area but she seems to have little patience for this 'occasional' side of my personality.
Which is wierd considering that she's obsessive compulsive as well (More ritualistic and controlling than me, we have different ends of the OCD coin see!) she doesn't really understand the panic attack feelings I get in public. Unfortunately, she's resolved a few 'Pure O' things in her, whereas I've sorted out most things of a ritualistic nature, so we both have a bit of a 'well you always have a choice' attitude to each others problems.
Sigh I don't know what this post will accomplish, I'm just after sympathy I suppose... :blushing:
Feel a lil trapped and on a collision course with something irrational and awful. Like I'm going to utterly lose it in the tube staion or on the street! :-(

"I wasn't having that bad a day until after I watched a movie this evening. I went outside for a smoke and it was dark and rainy and just felt this overwhelming sense of being alone. I start thinking about all these deep philosophical things. When I was younger these things used to excite me. Now I just get scared.
I've been spending some time looking into myself and trying to face the truth. I'm 25 and I don't know, maybe that's just part of growing up. Anyway I'll start thinking about some of the people I'm around in my life and about some of the things I do or things that happen. And I get this sick feeling to my stomach like everything is too real. It's like my mind is trying to solve a terribly scary and hard math problem. I say that because I start thinking about life in a deep way and how much there is to not understand.
Another thing that scares me is coincidences. Like for example the song that hear on the radio, but then you hear it somewhere else too, or then somebody mentions it. That type of thing but in different ways. I start to think about why that happens and what I have to do with it.
I just don't want to be so scared and so scared of myself. I really just miss enjoying simple things. Maybe this is my fault for spending too much time thinking. I don't know. But it just sucks how I can get like this after having days of being ok.

"Yesterday I had my last individual therapy for a while. My psychiatrist wants me to have some family therapy first to sort out my childhood issues, which they believe is the cause of my OCD. I am a bit scared about this, because since December when I was an inpatient at a private hospital I have been seeing a therapist once a week and been going to an OCD group (which has also finished).
It was quite a shock at the OCD group yesterday. A man in the group who has had OCD for a year has recovered and doesn't need to see his psychiatrist anymore. I have had it for 8 years and even though I do everything I am told to do I still have it the same as a few years ago when I started therapy.
Once the family therapy is over my psychiatrist is going to hopefully find me a therapist in my local area, so I can get there by myself. The family therapy could go on for 4 weeks. I have been having therapy once a week since September if you include the sort of therapy I received from the NHS, so I am very scared and unsure about waiting 4 weeks.
I feel so bad because of all the money being spent on my treatment, mainly by my mother-in-law. I feel I am letting them down, because I still have all my problems. I believe I am trying my best and my therapist and psychiatrist do to, but the improvement is very small.
Then there is the family therapy that is very scary, because my relationship with my parents is very fragile and they know the professionals blame my childhood for my illnesses. I don't know what to believe anymore. I don't remember my childhood and in all the photos I am smiling. I know I was a worrier as a child, but not abused in anyway. My parents aren't like that.

"Hello everyone!
I've had OCD for about three years now (still undiagnosed... I know), and originally the thoughts were centred around child abuse - this was horrible as at the time my niece was just under a year old and it made me so uncomfortable and I felt like a horrible person whenever I was around her. It was scarier at first as I obviously believed the thoughts because I had no idea OCD was anything other than hygiene-based! Over time, the thoughts lessened and my worries decreased. I still get the thoughts time to time but I'm able to ignore them, or if I can't I'm at least not consumed with the feeling of dread like I would in the past.
However, something happened this evening that triggered me in quite a big way. I was watching a film with her in bed and then I felt as if I had the urge to kiss her, not like you normally would kiss a child but I mean in a passionate way. I literally feel so scared.

I have started seeing a girl, we have a friend in common, a guy who is a bit irritating, but a nice guy, but he can really get on my nerves and enjoys winding me up sometimes. She gets on well with him, and spends a lot of time with him. I dont have a problem with their being friends as I get on well with him myself, but I did feel a bit jealous and Im on my period, so ended up being irritable, we also got into a few arguments of political views etc and I know Im easy to wind up, Where politics is concerned. I did tell them i was on my period and that was why I was hormonal. I havent told this guy we're going out, he knows im with someone but i've not told him who. I dont know if shes told him. I dont care and I know Im being paranoid about this guy because I get on OK with him on his own. We've only really had one date since I asked her out, the other two times we've been with him and i've not kissed her or anything.
Anyway, I felt very irritated today as i was a bit left out as they were talking about geeky things i know nothing about, and I found myself becoming irritated at his jokes etc, i didnt really say anything. When they left they left together. That isnt the problem I dont mind girls im going out with being with guys I just find this guy annoying, especially today. I know that sounds horrible. I know I can be annoying myself and tactless.
Howevver the problem is this. I think what if this means i have bpd? I know it will always find something to attack me with. I keep thinking Im possessive, (of my gf) controlling and insecure and intolerant of my gf's right to have friends, like my dad is to my mum. I keep thinking the reason Im irritated and threatened by this guy (which I know is unreasonable) is because I have bpd. Will this stupid bpd fear ever go?

"Hi guys,
I had another lovely moment today and I wanted to share it with you. Too much of OCD is full of negative, here was a negative turned out positive :original:
I woke up in a state of panic and dashed out of bed at 5:30am this morning to answer a call of nature. Normally if I woke up at that time I'd roll over and try and sleep, but I knew by the time I got back in to bed, with the alarm going off at 6am, it was pretty pointless. So I got up half an hour early. My OCD was giving me a tough time, but I ignored it and persevered. I stuck my slippers on, trudged my way into the kitchen and got some water. I then picked my keys up off the table, quietly unlocked the back door and sat on the bench outside.
Oh wow, what a beautiful moment.
As I sipped my water and let the bird's chorus melt away my anxiety, I breathed slowly, deeply. I closed my eyes and just listened, to the fountain, the birds, the Earth just waking up around me. Everyone else was asleep, but that didn't matter. This was my moment here and now. The warm morning sun on my face and the cold water cooling down the burning adrenaline that was running through my brains. There was no more panicking, I couldn't panic, the moment was too precious to panic. I think this will be a moment that lives with me for a long time. Such a simple pleasure, but oh so beneficial.
I'm now cracking on with some housework, no surprise I've been so calm I'm on my second lot of laundry and the dishes are done. Hubby hasn't even started work yet!

"Hi, as my username suggests- I Hate My Womb, I'm 25 and I have hated my womb from a young age. At first I thought it was having a period I hated, having a period was always very traumatic for me, I felt unclean, shameful, I was forever checking if I had made a mess of my clothes, or any bathroom I would use- eventually along with my periods in my early teens came depression, rounds of medication and treatment for 'period pains'. For years the Dr's told me that my womb was healthy and my depression was a seperate issue and that period pain/feeling low was all part of being a normal woman....well I'm not a normal woman, I'm a woman that would be much happier with a hystorectomy.
I have asked several times for this procedure and I keep being told that I may change my mind and want children, that I'm too young to know what I want.
Its not that I hate my vagina, its that I hate the capacity to have a child, I hate everything about it! I hate that it could have a thing growing in it, that egges are realeased, that the lining bleeds away once a month, It makes me so depressed thinking about it, I cant explain it- I have had my periods stopped through a contraceptive injection and I'm medicated for OCD, depression and BDD, luckily for the Dr's its the same umbrella of medicine so they just give me anti-depressants and keep upping the dose.
I do feel slightly better now that I dont have a period, but I know I still have a functioning womb and it doesnt feel part of me, its not something I want my body to have, if I had a hystorectomy, yes I would look the same, but I would feel complete, some days I wish I did not have a healthy womb so they would have to take it out (by womb I mean ovaries and fullopion tubes and some lining).
I don't have facebook, I hate looking at pictures of myself and I rarely let people take them, I have even had my vagina tattooed to try and make me feel better about whats inside me.
Most people just don't understand, I used to despair and cry everynight and some days was unable to leave the house or go to college/work.
I just wish I would stop being belittled by the medical profession for 'not knowing my own body'. It's mine, I live in it all day everyday, I know what would make me happy and I have felt like this since I was young and taught what the reproductive system does in science class.
JUST TAKE IT AWAY
anyway, I would like to hear from other people with BDD, any help/ advise is welcome, Thanks","['Thought', 'shame', 'checking', 'bathroom', 'Medication', 'Treatment', 'OCD', 'despair', 'depression']",0-0,0-0,1-0,checked 
"Hi all
something very strange happend to me earlier today, i was going through old doccuments having a clear out and found an old email address.
I logged in to see if i had any messages etc as its been dead for years.
and i found a message there from 2009 from a reply to a health board i posted on back then. This is when i was posting daily on these boards for HIV worries etc.
I clicked on it and felt a little odd doing it, but didnt want to just avoid it.
It was a response to a thread i wrote years ago about a time i used my mums diabetic lancet pen to test my blood sugar levels to see if i was diabetic as i was v ill at the time
long story short i freaked out a few months after using this thinking i could have caught HIV off it etc as my sister used it at one point and i dont know her HIV status. Even though everyone from Terrence higgins trust to health proffessionals telling me that it wasnt a needle as it isnt hollow. 0 risk of catching anything etc! you know how OCD doesnt let the facts sink in!
Anyway i read it, felt weird as it re surfaced all of these old wounds, and i kinda got a little trapped and its still lingering but i know i have moved on and i know that there is 0 risk even though this post told me that i should get tested. This is what made me worry abit, reading those replies again
this is where i think i have made an improovement though. I deleted the email, deleted the link to the site that it was from as i read the reply. and cleared the history on my laptop so i cant keep going back to it to study every word. Which the old me would have done.
So now i am letting the thought be there, waiting for the anxiety to drop. And see it as just a Trigger to a dealt with thought!","['OCD', 'site', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'drop', 'email', 'Thought']",0-0,0-0,1-0,Checked 
"Hi everyone
ok i know im going on about this and should just leave it, but my logic is coming in
and thanx to Bobby yesterday aswell with all his input with the situation
basically when i left the party i walked with a male friend to get some take out before getting a cab home. Spoke normally and was quite with it.
this is where the logic is kicking in that i didnt kiss the girl at the party. Basically i remember panicing cos my mobile phone was dead and i couldnt write myself a note saying that i didnt talk to the cab driver or anything.
So i paniced thinking oh no im gonna think 2mw that i slept with him (i did think that yesterday) but there was no worry or thought about the girl from the party.
So i would have been pancing about that and dying of guilt let alone worrying about getting a cab.
does that make sense?
i think what is making this thought linger is that i am quite cuddly, and so was the girl at the party. So we all hung out arms around eachother, my mind must have just really run a mile with it all and came up with its own story
as mentioned before, i am sooo faithfull and i consider a snog just as bad as sleeping with someone, and would have felt guilt there and then","['Thought', 'guilt']",0-0,0-0,1-0,Checked 
"So my period has ended, so I am back to obsessing over my breasts. Basically that the left is higher than the right and then realizing that I have no idea why I thought that and it should actually be the other way around.
I haven't looked down for three years. I even blindly measured it yesterday with a ruler and decided that the left my be much bigger than the right. I do remember that the left was a fraction higher than the right, despite the right being much bigger, when viewed from the side, I remember asking my mom for reassurance for this and I believe that she pointed it out.
So anyway I looked down, not the whole breast just the top when sitting. The left is still small compared to the right which is actually a fraction higher and I mean less than a Cm, when I stood up I asked my brother and he said that the left is a minuscule bit higher than the right when viewed from the side, so in short...they are about the same height...

"Hello everyone,
I am a new member to this forum, well I used to post on here about 4-6 years ago as OCD_Sarah. I just wanted to say hi to you all.
I am an OCD sufferer. I am 29 years old and I was diagnosed when I was 14 years old, though I believe I had it for most of my childhood prior to my diagnosis. I am currently suffering a relapse. I have been off work for nearly 3 months now and am quite housebound. My problems are fear that I will cause harm to others and contamination problems, involving inability to use a loo other than my one at home. I have excessive cleaning routines around using the toilet, which are approximately 1 hour per trip, though that is without all of the gearing up involved, so it effectively takes up around 3 hours a time. When working my checking was excessive, taking up hours of unpaid time. I am seeing an NHS Psychiatrist and they are trying to find a suitable medication. I will soon be starting drug number five, all tried in the last 3 months. There is currently no CBT available, due to a lack in trained professionals.
I had a severe episode in 2002-2004, where I was eventually hospitalised for 3 weeks and I feel that if I do not improve soon I may be hospitalised again. I am exhausted and depressed. I think about dying every day and I am losing the will to carry on. The last time I got ill I had the hope of recovery, this time I just feel that my life is going to be a constant round of relapse and partial recovery. After my last bout I never fully recovered to minimal OCD levels. My family support has dropped off as the novelty of my relapse has worn off, only my partner remains loving and supportive. i think that is why I am here, to be with people who understand. So that I can feel I am not alone.
I do not want to demoralize other sufferers so it is worth pointing out that I am probably above average in severity and my experiences are no those of an average sufferer.
On the flip side, I do have a vast knowledge and experience of OCD, also experience of hospitalisation, so if I can offer any advice I would be glad to help.

"The phrase """"a bump in the road"""" is often used when something goes wrong.
A bump in the road doesn't mean things grind to a halt or go backwards, it's not a negative.
The problem with OCD and anxiety is that it's so easy to see the negatives in a situation rather than the positives.
This afternoon my boyfriend had an honest chat with me about our relationship.
Our normal routine changed after summer, my mental health got worse, we moved to a smaller place, he is at home looking for a job having finished uni, we spend time with each other constantly, but that means it's easy to lose sight of how much you appreciate each other. You lose normal conversation, because I don't need to ask what he's spent his day doing, he's in the same room as me.
He realised that by trying to help me get better he has bubble wrapped me, he's taken all the chores and made them a part of his routine. My ocd is based around the theme of loss, the fear of losing those closest to me, but the routine we have adopted recently is exacerbating the problem. It's unhealthy.
He said (and I agree) that we need to start spending more time apart (Be it a few hours, or a day or two). What would happen to my anxiety when we both get full time jobs, if we've spent the past year constantly together? Obviously it would increase. Not only that, but my ocd has stopped me from spending time on my own, with friends, away from him.
I started to cry when we were talking because I was so upset my mental health had had this impact. But it's not just my health, it's a whole host of things. From now on I'm giving myself a proper 9-5 routine.
The days of the week I'm not at Uni I will go to my parents to do work. I have found a yoga class and will go one evening a week. I will spend more time with my friends and family. I will cook for him for half of the week days. I will reclaim my fair share of the chores.
A bump in the road does not stop the car from moving. A few weeks ago this conversation would have frightened the life out of me. But it's a positive. The only way to get better is to get on with it. Sod OCD. I need to reclaim my life, and this conversation, this bump in the road is the motivation I need.
I hope other members here have their own bumps in the road and can share them here, they are part of life and we've all got to keep the car moving forward.","['fear', 'talking', 'hope', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'OCD']",0-0,0-0,1-1,Checked 
"Hi everyone,
I haven't posted in a while, as I have tried to stay away from the forums as I thought that this was doing nothing other than help feed my anxiety and thoughts.
Anyway, I'm having a bad time at the minute.
I appreciate that you guys out there all have your own problems, and that perhaps I am just repeating everything that you have heard/read a thousand times open, but I have nowhere else to turn.
What's more, I don't blame any one for not replying, but if any one cuold take a moment to help me out a little then I would be really grateful.
Anyway, I have been trying to battle my pedo thoughts/feelings. As I say, before I think my OCD started, around 18 months ago, I NEVER looked at children or had any such thoughts/feelings.
I have been trying some of my own exposure. I have been looking at images of girls in catalogues on the internet, facing my anxiety. To be honest I have had mixed results.
As some of you may know, sometimes I am hit with the unstoppable feelings of attraction. My heart sinks immediately. I sit with the imagine, trying to battle these feelings. I have took the other approach, allowing the feelings to be there, which freaks me out, to be honest.
Sometimes, after a while the attraction will go. Indeed, there are images that I come across now that at one point I would have had groinal responses and everything to, but now, nothing. Which is all well and good.. you would think.
I jsut don't know what I am doing right/wrong. It takes a while for the feelings of attraction to subside. When I am out in the street, a young girl may walk by and I will be fixated on her. I instantly start checking for an attraction. I CANNOT help but check for attractions. Even when looking at images, how can you not check? What else are you supposed to think? If I look at an image, my mind automatically works out any attraction. that is something ive never understood.
But yes, I become fixated. This worries me. I feel horrible all the time I am looking but I need clarity.
Just now I drove past a girl that was perhaps 5 years old! And my mind was screaming an attraction at me. I didnt have time to sit and stare and let the attraction subside.
What am I supposed to do? Just carry on with the exposure like this or is there anything else I can do?
I cant stand it any more. Just walkign around and theres a little girl... before I would have thought nothing on it... not interested.. just a girl... now, theres a young girl, I am attracted. must keep looking and wait for it subside.
If any one has been through this and come out the other side I would love to talk to you! I am 21 years old, (just) and I feel as though I am living a nightmare.
I hope you are all well.
Thanks

"Keep busy and exercise.
Keeping the mind distracted eases rumination.Exercise burns off stress chemicals.Lets get busy and burn some stress off.
Lets:
Get some """"me"""" time - resentments lead to unhelpful emotions.
Stop asking questions - rumination makes things worse. Accept things.
Focus into the here and now and reality not imagination.
Try some yoga and meditation.
Not engage with intrusions - that gives them power.
Get distracted into things we like.
Change what we can accept what we cannot
Fight for our happiness
Switch from negative to positive bias.
Become a great dismisser.
Stop worrying. Worrying has no resolution. Using problem solving techniques does.
Live In The Present In The Moment
Smell the flowers taste the coffee
Relax - let go of all effort

"Ok so in the last week I've been to the doctors and he increased my clomipramine to 150mg. I'm not sure that how I feel is related to that increase because one week is pretty quick to start feeling the effects of an increase.
The resulting feeling is one of being grounded, no more derealisation, and almost anxiety free. I've still got the thoughts but I feel I can almost separate myself from them and look at them from a distance.
The strangest thing is that I don't know what to do with myself or what to think anymore? Taking away my anxiety has almost removed my motivation. It's obviously been my burden but also my motivation to do things.
So I feel in some kind of limbo. I no longer feel anxious, yet I no longer know how I should feel!!

I have worries of harming others and some of the thoughts are horrendous, and I sometimes get an unwanted image of stabbing someone that stays with me for a while. When I see a sharp knife a harming others thought comes into my mind.
At home I am having to do a few rituals where I hold up a sharp knife for a while to show that I wont lose control with it. I sometimes have to go from the kitchen to outside the lounge (the hallway) where my family are sitting to show that I would not go into the lounge and ever lose control with it. However I still worry that the OCD will make me go into the room in front of them with a knife to get rid of the thoughts. I would never, ever carry out these thoughts and worry that the OCD will make me do the ritual in front of family next and they will get scared and think I am going to use the knife when they see me with it. I am quite concerned at the minute. Any ideas please?

I am very suspicious of being happy at the moment (as well as almost every other thought and emotion) and find myself making sure that I am not having a thought at the same time as being happy. Daft I know.
Just a habit of constantly being on guard against them I suppose but just another habit I need to break or let go of.
This morning I caught a few thoughts before they had formed as I knew in the situation that my mind was going to throw one up. As a result I didn't have a spike.
I actually felt a sense of victory that I had beaten the thoughts to the punch and I guess that shows a good deal of habituation as I didn't particularly fear them coming either. I was wary but not truly fearful.
Of course then came the questions of did I like it, why am I calm is that a slight nervous feeling or happiness etc etc. I just stopped the rumination and moved on.
I still have the sense of nagging in the back of my mind again that says keep checking to see if you are scared but I am going to get on with my work and try to ignore it. The odd thought pops up but I am trying to just refocus and not react.
It feels like a very decisive moment where if I can just let go then I can make some real progress. I am thoroughly fed up of these thoughts now and dare I say it I am bored of being this way and fearing my own mind.

I have been struggling with OCD since I was very young. My first instance revolved around drawing cartoons as a child.

I have had many instances since, including exercise regimes, buying clothes and more. But the one that has stuck is my disorder when it comes to buying shoes. I can never seem to buy a pair of shoes that fit my feet or should I say, fit my schema of what a shoe should fit like.

"Hi,
Well some of you know about my long history with OCD and, for the past 7 years POCD in particular. It may be slightly non-OCD related but I was really hoping to get some non judgmental opinions.
Basically, recently I have realised that I am a cocaine addict. When I was 19/20 I went through a bad stage with lots of drugs, then nothing for about a year (I just stopped, with no effort, got a job etc), then since about a year ago I started using again. Cocaine is the main issue. Last year it was every day for a few months at a time. Now, it's whenever I can afford it, which is about twice a week. Not as bad as before, but still.
I have never felt like an 'addict' I never relied on it, I just enjoyed it a lot, and when I had other stuff to focus on I just stopped automatically without effort. When I get really severely unwell with my OCD, I lose all interest in drugs of any kind. It's just a non-issue at those times because my mind is so wrapped up with OCD that the last thing I'm thinking about is getting high. A few months ago, a friend who I tell most things to implied that I might have a problem. I then became a little obsessive over it for a while (not anymore), and it's only since others have said it, and now the guilt I feel after using (I never had that before), that I feel like I need it, rather than want. I hate using the term addict as it implies victim and almost puts you in the position of 'oh it's a disease, I can't help it' (I have a couple of friends who act like that).
The thing is, from past experience, bringing up drugs with any psychiatrist results in them focusing completely on that and away from my OCD, which is the main issue. Cocaine doesn't affect my OCD, and my worst episodes with OCD have occured before I ever touched a drug, so I don't want them to blame everything on drug usage.
Psychologically, since I considered the thought of me being addicted, it feels like some of the power has been taken from me. I now feel like I need it, panicky if I can't get it, depression when I'm not on it etc. Coming off it will be a piece of cake compared to dealing with OCD, but it will still be difficult now I think.
I want to get back to enjoying life without it, and feeling great and creative and productive while not on it. It is so expensive and pretty soon my financial situation is going to change and I will be living off very little, so there's no way I will be able to afford it regularly. I am on the waiting list for CBT at a specialist anxiety disorders hospital, which I've been waiting for for ages. I can't mess that up by having them make me start a drug program. Also, while a couple of people know about this, and my Mum knows about most of my past, I cannot risk her or other family members finding out as they are under huge stress at the minute and this would really upset and disappoint them.

In terms of not ruminating, can refusing to think about something also be a form of a avoidance?

Any good ways to take your mind completely away from the thought. I'm pretty good but it tends to linger like a shadow.

Also, any information on backdoor relapse would be good, as am trying my hardest to avoid one (and struggling), now I am at the point that the thoughts bother me less. Thank you .","['OCD', 'Thought']",0-0,0-0,1-0,Checked 
"when your in a bad patch with the ocd i am pure o btw.is it a case of riding out the storm??and waiting for the weeks,months,to feel better??or can you get the thoughts out of your system quite quickly?not sure if that makes sense??
But i have always found when i am in the o zone as i call it,it takes me weeks maybe months to recover or pull myself out of it why do i fall into the trap everytime i have a trigger it takes me such a long time to get on top again.
Another question is when you are in a bad patch do you feel funny like you are someone else or that you are in a daze??everything feels different to me like i am looking through mist or something i also have problems speaking.my words are unclear and really can not be bothered to speak sometimes as people ask me all the time """"what did you say"""" i then end up repeating,not sure if people can relate to this but it is how i am feeling at the mo.
Sorry this should of been a question post!
My mind is throwing all sorts of wiered thoughts at me at the momentand the keep coming,and they are more complicated than the last one more intense,someone must have advice that can rid me of this hell! :giljotiini:","['OCD', 'fall', 'Thought']",0-0,0-0,1-0,Checked 
"Hey guys,
Oh my god. Well I never knew that there would be a name for my problem, let alone tons of websites dedicated to it! I've been picking my scalp and shoulders since I was a teenager. I'm now 26 and find that I do it most when I'm stressed out, or worried. I generally have a fidgetty nature in that I CANNOT sit still - I'm always either picking my head, chewing my cheek, chewing my fingers, or fiddling with something. In addition I tend to have social phobias at times and a small (but at times significant) blushing problem. I also obsess over having diseases (cancer - ugh, its hard to even type the word - , HIV, STD's, etc etc). So I thought that I was just a generally anxious person. I guess OCD and anxiety tend to go hand in hand though. As with many OCD and anxiety-ridden people, I drink a lot to relax and feel at ease... this always just leads to more anxiety and depression the next day... anyone else agree??!!
Anyway, I have found a cure for myself to stop picking, scratching etc. I get false nails put on once every couple of months.. The thickness of the """"nails"""" does not allow me to get any 'leverage' under my scabs and I end up just not picking my head anymore! My head clears up in a few days and stays clear for as long as my nails stay on!
I just wanted to share that with people - hopefully someone else will try it and it will help.
Good luck, everyone!

"Im 25
Had OCD since I was around 14.
Im a Gay man. But my OCD was obsessed with the Subject of being a Peadophile
I would go over and over, in my head seeing why these thoughts occurred, checking over all m past with a dark cloud above it
making false memories
I Started to obsess murder , rape, everything that was bad. I would believe id hurt someday every day and create a false memory.
2 years ago I had a breakdown, put on very high ant depressants, have psychotherapy and did good for 2 years, Still having
sensation by proxy, but ignoring it. And knowing myself.
Now I'm not sure why Im back to a dangerous place, stuck and not knowing my own mind, Ive come from London to my mums house, but i don't feel any better, waiting to see therapist on Friday. I've convinced myself I'm a pedophile, i feel sick, unable to sleep, and my body feels exhausted. Like this is the end.
The thought I can't get over is because I used to constantly checking my groin area to see of any moments, obsessively , this is very in detail but i know other people suffer from doing the same thing, not checking physically but thinking if theres growth or anything.
I used to do the same thing in dreams, where if a child was near, I would be nervous.
I guess i just have to wait for therapist

"Hi guys!
so, I really don't know how to explain this, this can be got or bad at the same time.
it's really confusing.
Not having had OCD for one day made things even worse!!
how's it possible that not having thoughts actualy make things worse?? Last night I was finally after a long time sure of where my heart was!
I saw clearly how I would love to have a family, a boyfriend who loves me. But it's like when I don't have the thoughts so often as usual, I almost forget how ocd works, so when another thought come I am back at square one. (
It's a bid long, but please read, I need some advice!
It's always one step forward and two steps back!! every little improvent suddenly morphs into a big worsening. I'm so tired
A LITTLE INTRODUCTION
I've noticed that in the last 2 days my thoughts have been less bothering. I still had moments when I was very anxious but they seemed to be less strong and I could manage anxiety.
Wednesday I had an exam at university, while I was on the bus on my way to university my head was full of thoughts, but they disminished when I met my classmates and we started to talk about the exam.
Then a few hours later while I was still waiting for my turn, another student I had never seen before came in, she was a girl, she had a very pretty face, and when I saw her I was overwhelmed by anxiety. It was awful, I started thinking """"this is it, i'm in love with her, this must be love at first sight"""".
This girl (other than having a very pretty """"elegant"""" face and blond long hair) was not so good looking as I first thought.
Or at least she was not what I usually think a """"pretty"""" girl looks like, besides, she was a bit masculin , she was wearing a leather jacket, she was a bit overweight and she was definitely not graceful. At this point my sick mind started thinking that she looked like the (sadly) stereotype of a homosexual girl. So I started to think """"you don't think she's pretty, but you like her, you must like her because she looks like a lesbian"""" and at this point i was screwed. My heart started racing and I couldn't concetrate anymore. It was hell. Then I started to stare at her and see if I really liked her or not, and the more I didn't like her the worse I felt, because I would understand seeing a perfect curvy girl with beautiful legs and hair and thinking """"wow , she's pretty"""" that would be normal, but seeing a girl you don't even find good looking, and thinking you like her, means that you see something more in her!! and I was scared as hell. But then my classmate started talking to me and then the anxiety slowly went lower.
Yesterday things started going a bit better, though in the morning my anxiety was still bad, during the day it almost vanished. To the point that I had moments when I could think """"what are you even worrying about?"""" and it felt GREAT!! By last night my doubts , on a scale of 1 to 10 were around 4, so It was pretty good.
This morning I woke up and as usually at mornings I had a lot of anxiety, I was terrified that my thoughts would come back as strong as before, but I started to force myself to remember how I felt yesterday, how I used to genuinely thinkg how much i would love to have a boyfriend on my own and things like that.
Then I rememberd the dream I had last night and it was a very weird dream.
In this dream I was running away from my husband , and a friend of mine (girl) was with me, in one """"scene"""" of my dream"""" my friend was in bed, and I don't know if I was about to join her or what , butt then someone knocked at the door (my husband) and I started to flee. I just remember this woman on this bad with only a nightgown ,so the situation was ambiguos and it felt weird to think of it this morning.
After that, my husband found me and at first we were arguing in the hotel lobby but then I started to give him and receive oral sex and other sexual intercourses in a public place. I woke up so confused and anxious I felt ashamed like hell I don't even know why I have these kind of dreams actually!! But this dream worsened my anxiety.
Anyway, this morning I tried to not let the thoughts take over me again and I was realizing that I had anxiety but almost no doubts, I had a feeling that something """"wasn't right"""" but I wasn't really worried that I might like women or anything.
At that point my ocd started kicking in saying """"wow, that's a shame you don't like women..."""" and I was a bit freaked out but didn't let it ruin my day. Today I also went to see my therapist and we spoke a lot about my trust issues and my inhability of being around others , I worry a lot about what other people may think about me, I don't let my self out because I was psychologically bullied in high shcool, and I can't trust anyone now.
During the whole day, today, I felt positive that I didn't have any attraction towards girls. I had some thoughts now and again but ithey were very vague I didn't even pay much attention to them.
I could even listen to a gay guy's song on the radio without feeling anxious , and I felt ok.
This evening though, I saw a woman on tv singing, and she was pretty enough, but she had very shor hair, (which I really don't like in women) so I started having the same thoughts I had about that girl at university. A few minutes later my mom and I were looking at pics of her on the internet and we found a kind of provocative picture of her with a white tshirt and her nipples were quite visible, I felt weird about it, and suddnely anxious. didn't know what that meant.
Then I decided to try to do a litle ERP excercise and I typed """"breasts"""" on google and looked for 2 minutes at pictures of women's breasts and try to control my anxiety, and it worked quite well because I didn't have lots of thoughts and I didn't even feel attracted or anything I just noticed some of them looked """"good"""" others did not.
I realized that I feel very unconfortable looking at any kind of breasts, though. And it bugs me.
Now , my point to all this is that after a day without thoughts, I started wondering """"maybe it wasn't ocd, it went away too easily"""" (I've had these thoughts on and off for 2 years, but they got worse last september) and so when tonight they came back, I started thinking """"see? even without ocd you still think those things...taht must be because you like women"""" and I know it's not true, but I can't put my mind at rest right now. Besides, I don't have a strong interest in guys to contrast the fear of liking women, I am sure I don't like women but the """"what ifs """" and all the """"you dont like men either"""" kill me! It0s not true! I hate this!!
earlier tonight I was looking at picture of an acotr I used to love, (Ryan from The OC) and I thought """"wow he's really cute!!"""" then I rememberd another actress who worked with him in that show and I always thought she was pretty, (Rachel Bilson) so I looked at her pictures and saw how pretty she was, and I started thinking """"so, you think he's cute, and you think she's rpetty, how do you know which one you really like?"""" this bugs sooo much!
because, I mean .. I don't have fantasies of marring that actor, I just think he's very hansome, but then I think that girl is very pretty, she's basically perfect, of course I don't fancy her either but then how do I know where my heart is???
Does anyone relate to this? I feel like I am not going anywhere, I'll always be stuck with one good day and 2 bad days for the rest of my life !!","['overweight', 'talking', 'singing', 'interest', 'fear', 'shame', 'OCD', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'Thought']",0-0,0-0,1-1,Checked 
"There are days, well everyday really, when I wake up that I think to myself...Okay I got this...I can handle this. My years of self-therapy, meditation, CBT, ACT, professional therapy have equipped me with the tools to handle this. I can handle today, I tell myself with the utmost enthusiasm every day when I get up out of bed. Today I will go to battle with my OCD, and I WILL NOT LOSE.
Then the thoughts come...before I have even leave my bed.
At first I can allow them space, and just let them be there...
But then they come in stronger, and stronger. """"What if that person is a Demon?"""" """"What if I start hallucinating?"""" """"What if I lose my mind?""""
I breathe...trying to remember the tools I have learned throughout countless hours of therapy. Breathe, allow the thoughts to be there, make room for them I tell myself. You are not your thoughts, they are just clouds passing by in the sky.
This seems to work...for a short while.
Then the thoughts mount another attack so fierce that it seems as if Satan himself sent them and I can't help but to engage with them... """"What if I secretly want to harm them?"""" """"I've never hurt anyone, everyone knows that"""" """"But what if you have to kill them"""" """"I'd never do that""""
""""What if they poisoned my food?"""" """"They did poison your food"""" """"Wait, why would they poison my food."""" """"I'm going to eat this food anyway because they wouldn't poison it"""".
I become aware I'm engaging in them...I breathe. I tell myself it's just anxiety, It's okay... Lean into the thoughts, accept their presence. You are not your thoughts I tell myself...It's okay.
This is a typical day for me...then I have massive guilt that I didn't properly use mindfulness. I look at my relationship with OCD as an alcoholics relationship with alcohol. I think my body/brain is addicted to the adrenaline, the """"rush"""" so it creates more intense thoughts/vision/feelings/sensations to get that """"high"""" or it's fix. The ironic part is that the high/fix is so ******* ****, but it's my brains way of working to help protect me from those metaphorical lions.
I don't know why I wrote this, sometimes I think writing stuff out can be highly beneficial...I yearn to break the cycle, to be happy, to FEEL. Tomorrow is another day, and I feel try again.
I love you all and thank you for taking some time to read this.

"I just thought however insigificant or significant my life is in this whole world of different places, countries, timezones, lives I would share with you what its like to be. I got up this morning last minute, half eight, when I have to be in work for 8.15. I get up and throw myself roughly together cos the way I feel right now I cant be bothered to spend time doing anything properly. I would rather spend the extra half hour in bed then face the world and my anxiety today. I grab something convenient to eat and then drive to work, When I am there I am going about my business but feeling so bad inside all the while. When break comes and lunch I eat any old rubbish, I dont care about my figure or my health when I feel as bad as I do. If I get some little minute enjoyment from food at least that is some bit of enjoyment. The day passes relatively ok and I am good humoured and hard working throughout despite the immense anguish and depression in my brain. Its approx 18.27pm now I am home and on my laptop here, trying to convey what I feel. I am holding back tears in my eyes cos of how sad I feel that things in my life really arent that bad but I feel I dont deserve to enjoy me or my life as I am a bad person. I occasionally get thoughts about things I like which in turn cause my huge distress and pain. It happened the other night whilst showering, I had a thought that shocked me then it led to another that shocked me more, and threw me into a deep depression. Its all I can do now not to kill myself and free myself from this terrible misery. I have the capacity to feel good, to be good yet I feel I do not deserve it. How can I after all I have sick likings as I call it. My brain never leaves me alone, even today at work I had them. I dunno where to go from here. I am not supposed to ruminate but then nothing relieves this pain, nothing stops my guilt, my downright hatred for myself. I ask God why me, why do I have this horrible condition. How can I deserve a life...Thanks anyone for taking the few minutes out of your lives to read about mine, wherever you indeed are this sprawling strange World with no answers.....

"I'm not sure if this would be useful for anything but I wondered if anyone would like to write about how OCD affects them in one 24-hour period?
It would give an insight into all the challenges that people with different OCD symptoms face and how they overcome/manage these.
Perhaps this could be used to inform non-sufferers in some way too.
Would anyone like to share their typical day? or do you think this is focusing too much on the problem rather than the solution?
